{"lay_summary":"It can take several months , or even years , for the brain of a young animal to develop and refine the complex neural networks which underpin cognitive abilities such as memory , planning , and decision making . While the properties that support these functions have been well-documented , less is known about how they emerge during development . Dom\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice , using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups . The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains . The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth . Just before , however , the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation . After this pause , neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults . By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors , Dom\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life , suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species . Overall , the relative lull in activity before transition may mark when neural networks gain mature properties; in the future , it could therefore potentially be used to diagnose and monitor individuals with delayed cognitive development .","article":"Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity patterns to support cognition . Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated , but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown . We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice . We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development . The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence , after which spatially distributed , temporally precise , and internally organized activity occurs . We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans , suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation . We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks . \n Multiple cognitive functions emerge rapidly during early development . Neural networks enable precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in mature brain functions ( Fries et al . , 1997; Maingret et al . , 2016; Peyrache et al . , 2009; Khodagholy et al . , 2017 ) . How immature neural networks develop into their mature form needed for the complex computations underlying cognition remains poorly understood . The first organized and predominant pattern of neural activity that appears in cortical circuits across species is a spindle-like oscillation ( 10\u201320 Hz ) that occurs intermittently on a background of relative neural inactivity . Known as spindle bursts in rodents and delta brushes in humans , this immature network activity is commonly triggered by peripheral stimuli ( An et al . , 2014; Hanganu et al . , 2006; Khazipov et al . , 2004 ) . They demarcate cortical columns or pre-columns and have been linked to neuronal survival ( Golbs et al . , 2011 ) , establishing sensory ensembles , and critical period plasticity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Colonnese et al . , 2010; Khazipov et al . , 2013; Winnubst et al . , 2015 ) . Spindle bursts are characteristic of the first postnatal week of rodent development , and delta brushes disappear shortly after term in human neonates ( Torres and Anderson , 1985 ) , emphasizing their transient role in network maturation . In contrast , mature cortex exhibits perpetual , complex patterns of neural activity that appear and interact across a wide range of frequencies ( Tort et al . , 2009; Fujisawa and Buzs\u00e1ki , 2011; Bosman et al . , 2012 ) . The organization of this activity creates precise spatiotemporal windows for neural synchronization , enabling plasticity processes and generation of neural sequences ( Masquelier et al . , 2009; Geisler et al . , 2010; Foster and Wilson , 2006 ) . Such network properties facilitate information processing , and resultant activity patterns have been causally linked to cognitive processes from stimulus perception to learning and memory ( Fries et al . , 1997; Maingret et al . , 2016; Peyrache et al . , 2009; Khodagholy et al . , 2017 ) . Understanding when and how these properties develop in the immature brain is critical given that delay or failure to express mature brain activity is a strong risk factor for subsequent impaired cognition ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Anderson et al . , 1985; Seelke and Blumberg , 2008; Holmes and Lombroso , 1993 ) . We hypothesized that emergence of these advanced neural network properties could be heralded by the disappearance of immature activity patterns . During this developmental epoch , cortical microcircuits are still undergoing dramatic changes in anatomical connectivity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004 ) and functional connectivity between and within cortical layers is initiated ( Bureau et al . , 2004 ) in part through an abrupt increase in synaptogenesis in superficial layers ( Naskar et al . , 2019 ) . Robust GABA-mediated fast inhibition also appears ( Daw et al . , 2007; Goldberg et al . , 2011 ) as inhibitory network influences of interneurons increase ( Modol et al . , 2020; Tuncdemir et al . , 2016; Favuzzi et al . , 2019 ) . These local circuit changes are paralleled with the gradual ingrowth of subcortical neurotransmitters that assist in setting brain state changes . Together , such modifications could prime a shift in network operating mode , setting the stage for re-emergence of a different oscillation that occupies a similar frequency band , thalamocortical sleep spindles . In contrast to spindle bursts , these oscillations are characteristic of the offline state of non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep only , and they facilitate memory consolidation ( Maingret et al . , 2016; Latchoumane et al . , 2017 ) . To investigate this hypothesis , we examined neural network dynamics across early rodent and human development . We targeted epochs spanning disappearance of immature activity and emergence of mature sleep patterns in each species . For rodents , we developed conformable , minimally invasive , high-resolution electrocorticography arrays coupled with high-density implantable probes and recorded spontaneous in vivo electrophysiological patterns from unanesthetized mice across the first two postnatal weeks . This approach enabled simultaneous recording of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity without damaging fragile cortical circuits . We found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was characterized by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week . After this timepoint , precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged . Analysis of continuous electroencephalography ( EEG ) recordings from human subjects , 36\u201369 weeks post-gestation , revealed a similar developmental trajectory characterized by a transient decrease in neural activity prior to onset of spatiotemporal oscillatory coupling . Therefore , a shift from local , loosely correlated , prominently sensory-driven patterns to internally organized , spatially distributed , and temporally precise activity is preceded by a transient quiescent period . These findings suggest that mechanisms to developmentally regulate functional network capacity may be evolutionarily conserved and manifest on the systems level as similar , discrete states . \n To identify and characterize emergence of advanced neural network properties in the developing brain , we acquired high spatiotemporal resolution electrophysiological recordings from somatosensory cortex of unanesthetized mouse pups aged postnatal day ( P ) 5 to 14 ( n = 108 pups ) , an epoch that spans the transition from immature to mature activity patterns during sleep . We used minimally invasive surface electrocorticography arrays ( NeuroGrids , n = 70 pups ) to permit a spatially extensive survey of cortex . These customized NeuroGrids ( Khodagholy et al . , 2015 ) consisted of 119 electrodes regularly spaced on a diagonal square-centered lattice embedded in 4-\u00b5m-thick parylene C to conform to the cortical surface ( Figure 1A ) . Recordings were made following recovery from surgery to eliminate any influence of anesthesia ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Mice at these ages enter into a cyclical pattern of sleep and wakefulness as assayed by peripheral indicators , such as muscular tone , movements , and heart rate ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We ensured electrodes used for analysis were located in somatosensory cortex by postmortem histology . Following NeuroGrid recordings , the location of the array was marked on the surface of the brain using a biocompatible fluorescent material ( Rauhala et al . , 2020 ) and tissue was harvested for immunohistochemistry . vGlut2 staining identified the location of primary somatosensory and visual cortices relative to NeuroGrid placement on flattened axial slices ( Figure 1B , upper ) , and the spatially extensive nature of the array compared to the size of the pups\u2019 brains further facilitated anatomical targeting . This histology-based electrode grouping corresponded to spatial localization of electrophysiological activity patterns , identifying electrodes recording from somatosensory cortex ( Figure 1B , lower; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . To additionally capture neural spiking patterns across cortical layers , we stereotactically implanted silicon probes ( linear electrode arrangement ) in somatosensory cortex of a separate cohort ( n = 38 pups ) . Immunohistochemistry of coronal slices from these brains verified probe placement within somatosensory cortex , permitted allocation of recording electrodes to cortical layers ( Figure 1C , upper ) , and demonstrated transcortical neural spiking patterns ( Figure 1C , lower; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . We expected that physiologically significant features of neural network maturation would be conserved across species . Thus , in parallel , we obtained continuous EEG recordings from normal human subjects 36\u201369 weeks post-gestation ( 1 day\u00a0to\u00a07 months after birth ) , an epoch that similarly spans the transition from immature to mature activity patterns of human sleep and can be mapped to corresponding timepoints of rodent brain development ( Jouvet-Mounier et al . , 1969; Clancy et al . , 2001; Milh et al . , 2007 ) . We first identified epochs of artifact-free behavioral immobility consistent with sleep in the pups ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5 ) and compared the activity present with human sleep EEG . Sleep in the youngest mouse pups ( P5\u20137 ) was characterized by irregular , discontinuous bursts of neural activity ( Figure 1D , E , upper traces ) . The predominant activity was organized into spindle bursts , oscillations characteristic of developing rodent sensory cortex ( Figure 1D , left spectrogram ) . Sleep in the youngest human subjects recorded was also discontinuous , and contained delta brushes , an oscillatory pattern that develops by 26 weeks post-gestation and disappears around 40\u201344 weeks ( Khazipov and Luhmann , 2006;\u00a0Figure 1E , left spectrogram ) . Delta brushes share morphological and frequency characteristics with spindle bursts . Sleep patterns changed profoundly with maturation in both species . More mature mouse pups exhibited nearly continuous patterns during sleep , an absence of spindle bursts , and the appearance of sleep spindles , which are well-characterized oscillations of NREM sleep ( Figure 1D , lower trace , right spectrogram ) . Human sleep was similarly continuous , and sleep spindles appear during NREM between 1\u00a0and\u00a02 months after term in infants ( Figure 1E , lower trace , right spectrogram ) . This mature sleep in rodents and humans is predominantly governed by internally generated dynamics ( Levenstein et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , self-generated or evoked movements during sleep are closely associated with local field potential ( LFP ) activity in somatosensory cortex of immature rodents and humans ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Dooley et al . , 2020 ) . We confirmed that the association between muscular twitches and changes in LFP power ( Figure 1F; n = 6716 twitches from n = 52 pups , sampled randomly to ensure uniform group size; Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA , chi-square = 12 . 93 , p=0 . 0048 ) or detectable spindle band oscillations ( Figure 1G; cross-correlation of twitches and spindle band oscillations exceeded 95% confidence interval , black dashed lines , only in pups aged P5\u20137 ) decreased as the pups matured . These marked similarities in the electrophysiological features of neural activity during sleep across development suggest the possibility of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of neural network maturation . To investigate how this maturation occurs , we examined the macrostructure of sleep LFP with fine temporal precision over early pup development ( P5\u201314 ) . Mature sleep can be classified into distinct stages ( NREM and REM ) based on electrophysiological criteria , but these indicators do not reliably differentiate the immature analogues of these states ( quiet and active sleep , respectively ) until after P11 ( Seelke and Blumberg , 2008 ) . Therefore , we focused on periods of behavioral and EMG quiescence that lasted for longer than 10 s ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5 ) , with the goal of preferentially analyzing the transition of quiet sleep ( which contains spindle bursts ) into NREM sleep ( which contains sleep spindles ) . Unexpectedly , recordings across development revealed an epoch of relative neural quiescence at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 2A ) that corresponded to decreased spectral power and absence of prominent activity at physiological frequencies ( Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We hypothesized that this quiescence could be related to a transient decrease in the continuity of the neural signal or the power of the activity that was present . Continuity of neural activity was quantified by determining the duration of neural activity above the wideband noise floor . Although continuity increased markedly from the youngest to most mature animals , we found a decrease in the duration of continuous neural activity that corresponded to the identified period of spectral quiescence ( Figure 2C ) . When we extracted the average wideband power of the continuous activity that was present at each developmental day , there was also a transient nadir at this timepoint ( Figure 2D ) . Because we aimed to characterize the trajectory of the electrophysiological features over time without making a priori assumptions about the nature of the temporal relationship or the rate of change , we employed a modeling approach that considered age as a continuous variable . This approach avoided arbitrary grouping of data from different aged pups without sacrificing statistical power and enabled characterization of the developmental profile beyond testing at individual timepoints . Data were fit with linear and polynomial regression models , and model performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation ( LOOCV ) to avoid overfitting ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Polynomial regression provided the best fit for continuity and power data as quantified by the mean squared error ( MSE; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . In addition , linear regression was insufficient to model these parameters because linear fit residuals systematically deviated from zero and consistently overestimated observed values at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . The best fit models exhibited local minima , and to estimate the age at which these nadirs occurred , we employed a bootstrapping method . Bootstrapping data within each developmental day localized probability of nadir in continuity and power at the beginning of the second postnatal week with likelihood far exceeding the distribution obtained by bootstrapping across days ( Figure 2C , D inset , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We tested the possibility that the quiescence could be related to a shift in proportion of time spent in each sleep state , a decrease in self-generated sleep movements , or differential recovery from anesthesia across ages . In keeping with previous observations , the proportion of active relative to quiet sleep decreased gradually with maturation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A ) and we also found a trend toward fewer self-generated sleep movements in the more mature animals , though this shift was not statistically significant ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B ) . Recovery from anesthesia was determined individually for each pup , and there was no difference in post-anesthesia stability of oscillation occurrence rate or neural spiking across pups ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The absence of a marked shift in any of these features during the observed quiescent period makes them unlikely drivers of the phenomenon . Therefore , sleep LFP macrostructure expresses a nonlinear pattern of development that is characterized by a discrete period of relative neural quiescence occurring at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Rate and synchrony of neural spiking strongly contribute to expression of LFP patterns . We hypothesized that changes in neural spiking patterns could accompany the transient quiescent period . Spiking activity was detected in recordings obtained using implantable silicon probes from two non-contiguous sites ( >200 \u00b5m vertical separation ) within the deep layers of cortex ( IV\u2013VI ) and one site within the superficial layers of cortex ( I\u2013III ) per pup recording ( n = 38 pups ) . We first calculated rates of neural spiking only during epochs of above-threshold LFP activity to eliminate effects related to LFP discontinuity . We found that neural spiking increased nonlinearly over the course of development , again with a significant nadir at the beginning of the second postnatal week as quantified using a bootstrapping method ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These data suggest that lowered intracortical synaptic drive could contribute to the nadir in LFP patterns at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Consistent spiking within neuronal integration time is critical for plasticity processes ( Mainen and Sejnowski , 1995 ) . To estimate this property , we calculated the inter-spike\u00a0interval ( ISI ) between each unique action potential . ISI duration decreased nonlinearly across development , with the longest ISI duration occurring in pups at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Population neural spiking at fine time scales is thus both transiently decreased and desynchronized at this time in both superficial and deep cortical layers , resulting in a brief period of relative quiescence prior to the progressive increase in spiking rate and synchrony that accompany subsequent maturation . During mature NREM sleep , there is alternation between periods of neural spiking and hyperpolarization that serves to synchronize neural populations and is implicated in memory consolidation ( Ji and Wilson , 2007; Steriade et al . , 1993 ) . We examined population spiking dynamics in the developing cortex by computing the autocorrelation of spiking activity , which permits quantification of neural synchrony over durations relevant to this slow oscillation ( Figure 3C ) . Significant short time scale ( <50 ms ) interactions ( above the 95% confidence interval ) robustly emerged only after P9 and were prominent in the most mature pups ( Figure 3D , left; n = 38 pups , rank-sum z = \u22124 . 2 , p=2 . 5\u00d710\u22125 ) . All age groups demonstrated significant suppression of spiking activity within the first 500 ms , becoming more marked as development progressed ( Figure 3D , right; n = 38 pups , rank-sum z = 3 . 0 , p=0 . 002 ) . These data implicate that the transient quiescent period demarcates a transition in population spiking that initiates development of a cycle of longer scale network synchronization characteristic of the dynamics observed during mature sleep ( Steriade et al . , 1993 ) . We then sought to understand the functional relevance of this quiescent transition period to network operations . Key LFP properties ( spatial extent , waveform , and power ) can provide an index of the underlying neural population activity and its computational purpose \u2013 the distance over which neurons can be concurrently recruited , as well as the strength and temporal patterning of this activity ( Lowet et al . , 2015; Str\u00fcber et al . , 2017; Cole and Voytek , 2017; Stark et al . , 2014 ) . We detected spindle band oscillations , which were present in pups of all ages , to facilitate comparisons . We quantified spatial extent using the two-dimensional organization of the NeuroGrid to determine the proportion of electrodes expressing co-occurring spindle band oscillations with a reference electrode located in primary somatosensory cortex ( Figure 4A;\u00a0Dahal et al . , 2019 ) . Waveform was characterized using an asymmetry index ( Figure 4B ) and power was extracted from the filtered Hilbert envelope ( Figure 4C ) . Spindle band oscillations in the most immature pups were high power and had a substantially asymmetric waveform , but were expressed over a restricted cortical area ( ~480 \u00b5m diameter ) . In contrast , spindle band oscillations in the most mature pups were lower power and more symmetric , but could variably be detected over a larger spatial extent ( ~1 . 4 mm diameter ) . Given these observed differences in oscillatory parameters , we asked to what extent they could be used to classify the developmental stage at which the oscillations occurred . A coarse tree model based on spatial extent and waveform asymmetry of manually identified oscillations was effectively trained to classify individual spindle band oscillations as originating from immature ( P5\u20137 ) or mature ( P10\u201314 ) pups with 92 . 4% accuracy ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that these parameters capture defining features of the oscillations at the ends of the developmental spectrum . Spindle band oscillations that occurred during the transient quiescent period at the beginning of the second postnatal week were not consistently classified into either group , instead displaying a unique combination of oscillatory parameters: large spatial extent , low power , and intermediate waveform asymmetry ( Figure 4A\u2013C , yellow bars ) . When examined in a combinatorial fashion , a significant inflection point in oscillation properties emerged between P8\u00a0and\u00a09 ( Figure 4E ) . Polynomial regression provided the best fit for these data ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Bootstrapping data within each developmental day confirmed localization of a nadir at the beginning of the second postnatal week with likelihood far exceeding the distribution obtained by bootstrapping across days ( Figure 4F ) . These data indicate that oscillations are transformed at the beginning of the second postnatal week , potentially reflecting a transition in neural network function from consistently highly localized cortical processing to capacity for broader , tuned recruitment of neural activity . Oscillations in the adult brain precisely organize neural activity across spatial and temporal scales . A key marker for this organization is cross-frequency coupling , which is important for regulating strength of inputs from different afferent pathways ( Schomburg et al . , 2014 ) and directing flow of information processing ( Buschman and Miller , 2007 ) . The marked shift in oscillatory properties that we observed at the beginning of the second postnatal week suggested that this organizational capacity may also be developmentally regulated . We first investigated the relationship of spindle band activity with other frequencies by detecting epochs of sustained increase in spindle band power and calculating measures of amplitude cross-frequency coupling . Spindle band epochs in the most immature animals ( P5\u20137 ) demonstrated high comodulation across a broad , non-specific range of frequencies , in contrast to frequency-specific comodulation expressed in mature animals ( P13\u201314; Figure 5A ) . Specific , discrete frequency bands that demonstrated significant temporal coupling with spindle band oscillations emerged only after P8\u20139 . Discrete coupling with the gamma band ( 45\u201360 Hz ) first occurred at P10\u201312 , with an additional high gamma band ( 60\u201390 Hz ) arising at P13\u201314 ( Figure 5B; n = 1020 spindle band oscillations from 51 pups; area under the\u00a0curve [AUC] for 45\u201360 Hz chi-square = 10 . 13 , p=0 . 02; AUC for 60\u201390 Hz chi-square = 24 . 29 , p<0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that immature networks lack the capacity to couple discrete frequency bands , whereas after the beginning of the second postnatal week such capacity emerges , potentially signaling a developmental shift in the function of oscillations . Furthermore , oscillations facilitate neural communication by biasing spike occurrence to particular phases of the oscillatory waveform . Spindle band oscillations recruited neural spiking above baseline rates to a variable extent across development , with the lowest amount of recruitment occurring at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This trajectory significantly deviated from linearity with a discrete nadir confirmed by bootstrapping during this epoch ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . P8 and P9 also exhibited the lowest proportion of recording sessions with significant phase-locking ( kappa > 0 . 1 and alpha < 0 . 05 ) , and consistency of phase-locking abruptly increased at P10 ( Figure 5D , E; n = 38 pups implanted with silicon probes ) . These results reinforce the notion of enhanced information processing capacity in cortical networks after a rapid transitional period at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Thus , multiple LFP and neural spiking measures followed a similar highly nonlinear developmental trajectory marked by a key transition at the beginning of the second postnatal week in mouse pups . We next aimed to investigate whether this pattern of neural maturation was conserved across species . To accomplish this goal , we analyzed clinically acquired continuous EEG data from 54 human subjects ranging from 36 to 69 weeks post-gestation . EEG recordings were included for analysis only if they were reported as normal by the reading epileptologists and the subject had no known underlying neurological or genetic condition . The majority of subjects received a discharge diagnosis of normal movements\/behaviors ( e . g . , sleep myoclonus ) or brief resolved unexplained events ( BRUE;\u00a0Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We analyzed epochs of clinically determined quiet\/NREM sleep from each subject using data derived from electrodes overlying human somatosensory cortex ( parietal or central electrodes; no differences were found between these localizations; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Raw traces and normalized spectral analysis suggested an epoch of transient neural quiescence between 42 and 47 weeks ( Figure 6A , B ) , akin to what we observed at the beginning of the second postnatal week in mice . To quantify these observations , we again used regression fitting to determine whether a nonlinear trajectory was present and bootstrapping of data within and between ages to identify any significant nadirs in neural activity patterns . Wideband power of oscillatory activity followed a highly nonlinear trajectory , with a significant nadir between 42\u00a0and\u00a047 weeks ( Figure 6C , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Power spectra revealed a lack of prominent frequency peaks during this epoch , as well as an overall steeper decay in power with increasing frequency ( corresponding to a larger exponent for the modeled power law; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C ) . Quantification of this aperiodic component of the power spectrum across ages similarly revealed a transient increase around the time of nadir in wideband power ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D , E ) . As expected from previous work ( Torres and Anderson , 1985 ) , duration of oscillatory epochs generally increased over development , but we did observe a period of relative stationarity coinciding with the decrease in wideband power ( Figure 6D , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . To assess properties of oscillatory activity in these subjects , we detected spindle band oscillations . Such oscillations were present in all ages , consistent with delta brushes in the youngest subjects and sleep spindles in the older subjects ( Figure 6E ) . We calculated spatial extent of these oscillations as the co-occurrence of spindle band activity across EEG electrodes and found that this activity shifted from highly localized to broader cortical expression around an inflection point between 42\u00a0and\u00a047 weeks ( Figure 6F , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . We also found evidence for significant cross-frequency coupling of higher frequencies with the spindle band emerging after 47 weeks post-gestation ( Figure 6G , H; n = 702 spindle band oscillations from 13 subjects; Kruskal\u2013Wallis chi-square for AUC = 138 . 4; p<0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these data support the existence of a conserved transient quiescent period in development that bridges a dramatic shift in functional properties of neural networks . \n We demonstrate that maturation of cortical network dynamics is preceded by a discrete , relatively quiescent , evolutionarily conserved transition period during early postnatal development . During this period , oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir that signals the shift from local , loosely correlated , putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized , spatially distributed , and temporally precise activity . Such a developmental inflection point may reflect a rapid and confluent engagement of mechanisms that enable mature computational processes within cortical networks . Self-organization in complex systems is often mediated by processes that can facilitate sudden transitions in system behavior . Our results provide evidence for such a transition in developing cortex of rodents and humans . Because rodent neurodevelopment is temporally compressed relative to humans , an inflection epoch that lasts 1\u20132 days in mouse pups could conceivably extend over weeks in humans ( Clancy et al . , 2001 ) . Prior to this inflection point , oscillatory activity was intermittent with non-uniform cycle-to-cycle waveforms and high broadband frequency coherence . Oscillatory activities after the transition became nearly uninterrupted , exhibiting coupling at discrete frequency bands and increased waveform symmetry . Based on these similarities in oscillatory patterns , we infer that the neural spiking features we observe through invasive recordings in mouse pups could also extend to normally developing human infants , where such recordings are not possible . Neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent , strong phase-locking , and higher temporal precision . These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing ( Masquelier et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations . Our results suggest that the cortical network dynamics shift to permit temporally precise neural spiking after the transition period . Significantly synchronized firing within 10\u201350 ms intervals was absent prior to this period and robustly emerged afterward . This result is consistent with observed increase in pair-wise correlations of spike activity in visual cortex over development ( Colonnese et al . , 2017 ) . Although recruitment of neural spiking during epochs of spindle burst oscillations in immature rodents likely co-activates neurons that share similar afferent inputs ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Colonnese et al . , 2010; Khazipov et al . , 2013; Winnubst et al . , 2015 ) , more precise coordination is required for establishment of flexible , defined neural assemblies ( Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki , 2006 ) , and the capacity of circuits to express sequential activation of these assemblies is developmentally regulated ( Farooq and Dragoi , 2019 ) . We found that the neural population activity demonstrated correlated suppression over a progressively shorter duration ( from approximately 500 to 200 ms ) with maturation . This process is in keeping with the progressively decorrelated activity patterns observed when analysis is performed on the time\u00a0scale of calcium indicators ( Golshani et al . , 2009; Rochefort et al . , 2009 ) . When oscillations occur in discrete frequency bands , the possibility for complex comodulation arises . This cross-frequency coupling has been linked to information processing in the mature brain , though the precise anatomical substrates and physiological mechanisms that enable its expression are often unknown ( Tort et al . , 2009; Fujisawa and Buzs\u00e1ki , 2011; Bosman et al . , 2012 ) . We demonstrated that prior to the transient quiescent period the dominant cortical oscillations ( centered on spindle band ) exhibit high comodulation extending from 1 to 100 Hz . During this period , broadband comodulation abruptly decreased and was subsequently replaced by discrete gamma oscillations . Therefore , the oscillatory infrastructure to support cross-frequency coupling arises concomitantly with fine time-scale neural spiking synchronization and robust phase-locking of these spikes to LFP , suggesting an emergence of adult-like information processing capacity at this developmental timepoint . Despite sharing a peak frequency , immature and mature spindle band oscillations are highly differentiable on the joint basis of waveform , power , and spatial extent . Correspondingly , the cellular mechanisms that permit expression of these oscillations , as well as their functional purpose , are different . Comparison of oscillatory features can shed light on the functional capacity of the network . We found that although of high amplitude , spindle band frequency oscillations in the most immature mouse pups were highly and uniformly confined to localized regions of cortex ( 200\u2013500 \u00b5m ) roughly corresponding to cortical columns ( Yang et al . , 2013; Feldmeyer et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , human delta brushes exhibited restricted localization even given the limited spatial resolution of clinical EEG . During the transition period , spindle band oscillations in mouse pups had higher spatial extent , but markedly reduced amplitude , perhaps facilitated by increased intracortical synaptogenesis and maturation of corticothalamic afferents ( Naskar et al . , 2019 ) . The transition period in humans was marked by transiently decreased spatial extent of spindle band oscillations , which we hypothesize is related to attenuation of low-power activity by the intervening tissue between cortical surface and scalp electrode . We observed that mature spindle band activity across species was characterized by increased and customizable spatial extent . Thus , the end of the transient quiescent period marks capacity for oscillatory frequencies that were previously confined to local processing units to extend into broader cortical areas with the potential to establish intercortical communication . Our study was limited to somatosensory cortex , and the existence of a transient quiescent epoch outside of this brain region is unknown . Similar to our results in the spindle band , early gamma oscillations disappear around the beginning to the second postnatal week , to be later replaced with gamma rhythms characteristic of adult animals ( Minlebaev et al . , 2011 ) . In visual cortex , a transient nadir in continuity was not identified , but continuity did rise sharply after P8 with a nonlinear trajectory ( Shen and Colonnese , 2016 ) . Furthermore , the least synchronous neural spiking activity in visual cortex occurred at the beginning of the second postnatal week , potentially in keeping with our decrease in temporal precision of spiking at this time ( Colonnese et al . , 2017 ) . Higher order cortices , which do not directly receive sensory thalamic inputs , may express a different developmental trajectory , in keeping with their distinctive role in information processing , though oscillatory expression during this same epoch has been identified as critical for intact adult function ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2015; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2021; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , multiple lines of evidence support an abrupt change in cortical network function at the beginning of the second postnatal week . It is possible that our use of surface arrays , which sample summated LFP\u00a0activity from the undisturbed superficial cortical layers ( I\u2013III ) , highlights the transient quiescent state compared to penetrating probes that disrupt the cortical surface upon implantation . Furthermore , our conducting polymer-based electrodes have lower impedance than the silicon probes used in most neonatal rodent studies ( Khodagholy et al . , 2015 ) , potentially increasing the sensitivity to changes in oscillatory power and continuity . Given the multitude of anatomic and functional changes that occur during the early postnatal epoch , it is likely that the shift in network operating mode we observe is mechanistically multifactorial . A potential driver for this state is maturation of functional cortical inhibition . Functional inhibitory connections regulate physiological oscillations in mature neural networks enabling submillisecond precision of spike timing and facilitating inter-regional synchronization ( Buzs\u00e1ki and Chrobak , 1995; Cobb et al . , 1995; Pouille and Scanziani , 2001 ) . In contrast , interneurons do not substantially pace immature oscillations during the first postnatal week , though they can be recruited to and contribute to spatial properties of this activity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Minlebaev et al . , 2011 ) . Functional feedforward inhibition rapidly matures around the beginning of the second postnatal week in mice , resulting in emergence of adult-like hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials and precisely timed action potentials in glutamatergic neurons within the microcircuit ( Daw et al . , 2007 ) . This timepoint , derived from in vitro data , temporally overlaps with the onset of adult-like neural network activity we observe in vivo . In the human brain , when mature functional inhibition arises is not known , but ongoing migration of cells that differentiate into interneurons in the months after birth ( Paredes et al . , 2016 ) suggests the possibility of a postnatal transition to such network activity . The aperiodic component of the power spectrum has been linked to excitatory-inhibitory balance ( Gao et al . , 2017 ) , and our finding that this value transiently increases during the quiescent period could support a temporary increase in inhibition in the human brain . Such a mechanism could underlie the known postnatal disappearance of the EEG bursts characteristics of trace alternant ( Ellingson and Peters , 1980 ) , resulting in the observed low-voltage state with lack of organized oscillatory activity prior to emergence of mature NREM sleep patterns . Whether a period of quiescence is required for physiological transition to mature cortical processing remains unclear . Manipulations that could modulate its expression , such as alteration of the neuromodulatory milieu , activation\/suppression of specific cell-type activity , or modulation of the sensory environment ( Smith et al . , 2018 ) , could address this question . Forging linkages to activity patterns observed using calcium imaging ( Wilson et al . , 2018 ) and enabling high spatiotemporal resolution chronic in vivo electrophysiology will also be critical . In humans , neuronal dynamics suggestive of mature information processing mechanisms are established by 6 months of age ( Jannesari et al . , 2020 ) , and changes in sleep patterns have been identified as markers for brain connectivity from toddlers to adolescents ( Kurth et al . , 2017 ) . Extending such measures to earlier timepoints could help to clarify functional ramifications of the quiescent period in humans . Furthermore , the manifestation of a developmental epoch of relative quiescence in electrophysiological activity suggests the possibility for use as a network-level biomarker that could be altered in disorders of neurodevelopment , from mouse models to human subjects . Neural processes in the adult brain are characterized by a specific constellation of network dynamics that are necessary for execution of complex behaviors and cognition ( Tolner et al . , 2012 ) . Our results suggest that the capacity for these processes simultaneously emerges abruptly after a distinct transition period characterized by relative neural quiescence . This transient quiescent period may be a critical stage that indicates a shift in the neural network operating mode from a predominantly external stimulus-driven state to one that facilitates the internal representations associated with planning and executive function . \n PEDOT:PSS ( Clevios PH1000 ) was purchased from Heraeus . Ethylene glycol , ( 3-glycidyloxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( GOPS ) , 4-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid ( DBSA ) , and\u00a03- ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( A-174 silane ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich . Micro-90 concentrated cleaning solution was purchased from Special Coating Services . AZnLOF2020 ( negative photoresist ) , AZ9260 ( positive photoresist ) , and\u00a0AZ 400K and AZ 300MIF ( metal ion free ) developers were acquired from MicroChemicals , Merck . To create the PEDOT:PSS films , a mixture of aqueous dispersion ( Clevios PH1000 ) and ethylene glycol was prepared and mixed with GOPS ( 1\u00a0wt% ) and DBSA ( 0 . 1 wt% ) . The fabrication process involved deposition and patterning of parylene C , evaporation of Au for electrodes and interconnects , and PEDOT:PSS films coating . Parylene C ( 1 . 2-\u03bcm-thick ) was deposited on quartz wafers ( 100 mm outer diameter [O . D . ] , thickness of 1 mm ) using an SCS Labcoater 2 . For the metal lift-off , AZnLOF2020-negative photoresist was spin-coated at 3000 r . p . m . on the substrate , baked at 105\u00b0C for 90 s , exposed to ultraviolet light using a Suss MA6 Mask Aligner , and developed with AZ 300MIF developer . Metallic layers ( 10 nm Ti , 150 nm Au ) were deposited using an e-beam metal evaporator ( Angstrom EvoVac Multi-Process ) and patterned by soaking the substrate in a bath of resist remover . A second layer of parylene C ( insulation layer ) was deposited to a thickness of 1 . 2 \u03bcm and its adhesion to the bottom layer was enhanced by the addition of 3- ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( A-174 silane ) during chemical vapor deposition . An anti-adhesion agent ( 5 wt% Micro-90 diluted in deionized water ) was deposited on the substrate followed by an additional sacrificial layer of parylene C that was subsequently used for the peel-off process . The stacked layers were patterned with a layer of AZ9260-positive photoresist and dry etched with a plasma-reactive ion-etching process ( Oxford Plasmalab 80; 180 W , 50 sccm O2 , and 2 sccm SF6 ) to shape electrode area and electrical contact pads . Specifically , AZ9260 was spin-coated at 5000 r . p . m . , baked at 115\u00b0C for 90 s , exposed using a Suss MA6 Mask Aligner , and developed with AZ400K developer ( 1:4 with deionized water ) . To obtain clean etching of large areas , the electrical contact pads were guarded by an extra layer of AZnLOF2020 ( 3000 r . p . m . ) between the metal layer and the silane-treated parylene . Each pad was etched along its perimeter , and the parylene deposited on top of the photoresist was removed once immersed in acetone bath . Finally , PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the electrodes and patterned by peeling off the last parylene layer . The probes had 119 electrodes regularly spaced on a diagonal square centered lattice with pitch of 77\u2013177 \u00b5m and regularly interspersed perforations were created . Total device thickness was 4 \u00b5m . All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University Irving Medical Center . Data from 108 Swiss-Webster mouse pups ( 3\u20139 g , 5\u201314 days of age ) that underwent intracranial implantation was used for neurophysiological analysis . Pups were kept on a regular 12 hr\u201312 hr light-dark cycle and housed with the mother before surgery . No prior experimentation had been performed on these mice . Anesthesia was induced by hypothermia in ice for P5\u20136 pups and with 3% isoflurane for pups aged P7\u201314 . Pups were then comfortably placed on a customized platform for head fixation , surgery , and recording . Acclimatization to head fixation was not performed as it has been found to be unnecessary for neonatal rodents; careful positioning and \u2018swaddling\u2019 was performed to maximize pup comfort ( Blumberg et al . , 2015; Corner and Kwee , 1976 ) . All animals were maintained under anesthesia with 0 . 75\u20131 . 5% isoflurane during surgery . Time under anesthesia was minimized to facilitate postoperative recovery . Pre- and postoperative systemic and local analgesics were employed , including subcutaneous bupivacaine , systemic ketoprofen , and topical lidocaine . These analgesics were selected to attain appropriate pain control while minimizing effects on neurophysiological activity in the postoperative period ( Blumberg et al . , 2015; Foley et al . , 2019 ) . Electrodes fabricated from fine gauge wire were inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of the neck and abdomen . These electrodes continuously registered electrocardiography ( ECG ) and electromyography ( EMG ) signals throughout the surgical and recording period , and were used to monitor recovery from anesthesia . A custom metal plate was attached to the skull to provide head fixation . For NeuroGrid implantations , a craniotomy was centered over primary somatosensory cortex and the array was placed over the dura . For silicon probe implantations , H32 NeuroNexus 32-site single-shank probes were used . A small cranial window over primary somatosensory cortex ( approximately AP \u22121 . 5 mm , ML 2 mm; adjusted proportionally based on pup age ) was opened , and the probe was stereotactically advanced until all electrodes were inserted below the pial surface ( 900 \u00b5m ) . Postoperatively , the pup was comfortably positioned , provided with familiar olfactory cues , and placed in a custom recording box with temperature and humidity control . Temperature was regulated by a heater equipped with feedback control to ensure stable , physiological body temperature of the pups throughout the recording period . Neurophysiological signal acquisition was performed in the custom recording box , which was grounded to shield ambient electrical noise . Concurrent video monitoring was performed using a camera mounted inside the box . Pups recovered from anesthesia , as determined by recovery criteria including increase of heart rate to plateau and onset of sleep-wake cycling , for a minimum of 30 min before neurophysiological recordings were used for analysis . The recovery period was prolonged until recovery criteria were met , and all pups used for experimentation recovered within 60 min postoperatively . Neurophysiological signals were amplified , digitized continuously at 20 kHz using a local preamplifier ( RHD2000 Intan Technology ) , and stored for offline analysis with 16-bit format . Spontaneous activity was acquired for 1\u20132 hr prior to euthanasia and perfusion . At the end of experimentation , pups were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital ( 100 mg\/kg ) . For the NeuroGrid experiments , the position of the array was visualized using light microscopy and the brain tissue underlying the corners of the array was stereotactically marked using a 30 gauge needle coated with chitosan compound ( Rauhala et al . , 2020 ) . Pups were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , followed by 4% paraformaldehyde . Brains were stored for 24\u201348 hr in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C prior to transfer to PBS solution . Cortices were \ufb02attened at room temperature ( RT ) after removal of the underlying midline structures and kept in 4% PFA for 24 hr ( 4\u00b0C ) . Flattened cortices were sliced using a Leica vibratome vt1000S at 50 \u00b5m . The slices were then incubated for 1 hr at RT in a blocking solution composed of PBS ( 0 . 01 M ) , 3% Normal Donkey Serum , and 0 . 3% Triton X-100 . Slices were transferred to a solution containing anti-Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 ( VGlut2 ) polyclonal guinea-pig antibody ( AB2251-I Sigma Millipore ) in a 1:2000 dilution and kept overnight at 4\u00b0C . Subsequently , the tissue was washed and incubated with secondary antibody , Alexa Fluor 594 Af\ufb01niPure Donkey Anti-guinea pig IgG ( H+L ) ( 706-585-148 ) from Jackson Immunoresearch at 1:1000 dilution . Lastly , the tissue was incubated with DAPI ( D9542-5MG; Sigma-Aldrich ) at 0 . 2 \u00b5g\/mL and after washing , the brain slices were mounted with Fluoromount-G ( 00-4958-02 , ThermoFisher ) . Fluorescent images were captured and tiled using a computer-assisted camera connected to an ECHO Revolve microscope . The images were adjusted for brightness and contrast and assembled into panels using ImageJ and Adobe Illustrator . The regularly spaced , hexagonal lattice of electrode spacing across the NeuroGrid enabled localization of each electrode relative to the marked corners of the array and primary sensory cortices . The spatially extensive nature of the NeuroGrid relative to pup brain size facilitated consistent anatomical targeting . Localization of silicon probe electrodes to cortical region and layers was performed using a combination of intraoperative visualization and histological reconstruction . Probes were inserted under visual guidance , with the most superficial electrode placed just below the pia . Regular , precise spacing of electrodes along the shank enabled determination of each electrode\u2019s depth from the cortical surface . Coronal brain slices stained with DAPI and vGlut2 permitted localization of probe implantation site relative to barrel cortex . All recordings were visually inspected for quality , and channels that exhibited ongoing electrical or mechanical artifact were removed from analysis . Data was analyzed using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) and visualized using Neuroscope . Raw recordings were downsampled to 1250 Hz to obtain LFPs , and band-pass filtered between 250 Hz and 2500 Hz for analysis of neural spiking . Signals from EMG wires inserted into nuchal and ventral subcutaneous tissue were high-pass filtered at 300 Hz , rectified , and smoothed to obtain a power envelope . The mean of this high-pass filtered power was determined . Epochs consistent with high tone were identified when the signal surpassed a threshold defined by 1 . 5\u20133 . 5 standard deviations above this mean . Wakefulness was defined as a period of sustained high tone for at least 1 . 5 s . Myoclonic twitches involving contractions of the muscles of the head , forelimbs , hindlimbs , or trunk as observed on video recording were correlated with an increase in EMG signal that surpassed the threshold for < 1 . 5 s . Muscle atonia ( consistent with sleep ) was identified when the EMG signal remained below the threshold for at least 2 s . Sleep epochs were further classified as putative active or quiet sleep . Quiet sleep was identified when muscle atonia was paired with quiescence of behavior for at least 10 consecutive seconds . Active sleep was identified by myoclonic twitches that occurred on a background of muscle atonia . Similar approaches have been shown to correlate with electrophysiological markers of active and quiet sleep , and have been used for state-dependent developmental analyses ( Seelke and Blumberg , 2008; Turek , 1999 ) . We retrospectively analyzed EEG recordings from 54 patients who underwent continuous monitoring with surface EEG as part of clinical diagnostic assessment . Analysis of these data was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Irving Medical Center , and all data collection occurred at this institution . All data reviewed was initially obtained for clinical management purposes and informed consent was waived as per 45 CFR 46 . 116 . Each patient had EEG electrodes placed based on the internationally recognized 10\u201320 configuration . Electrode impedance was monitored and maintained within appropriate ranges as per American Clinical Neurophysiology Society Guidelines by certified clinical EEG technologists . Patients ranging in age from birth to 8 months who had at least 4 hr of high-quality continuous EEG monitoring were identified through the clinical electrophysiology database ( Natus ) . Using the hospital admission record , patients were excluded if ( 1 ) the EEG was reported as abnormal by the reading electrophysiologist; ( 2 ) the patient had a known underlying neurological or genetic condition; ( 3 ) the patient was diagnosed with a new neurological condition during the course of the hospital admission; and ( 4 ) corrected gestational age could not be determined from information contained in the medical record . Indication for EEG in eligible patients was most commonly paroxysmal movements concerning to parents for abnormal activity , with discharge diagnosis identifying normal movements\/behaviors ( e . g . , sleep myoclonus , roving eye movements during REM sleep ) or BRUE ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Corrected gestational age , rounded to the nearest week , was used to classify patient age . If the phrase \u2018full term\u2019 was employed in the medical record , corrected gestational age was calculated based on birth at 40 weeks . This approach allowed a precision of 2 weeks in corrected gestational age . Recordings always included both waking and sleep epochs . Three to five representative epochs of artifact-free quiet\/NREM sleep were identified for subsequent analysis by a certified clinical electrophysiologist . Data was sampled at 256\u2013512 Hz by clinical amplifiers . Raw data ( referential ) exported from Natus was used for all analyses . If electrical noise contaminated the recording , a 60 Hz notch filter was used . P3 or P4 electrodes , overlying the parietal lobe , were selected for spectral analysis . If these electrodes were non-functional , C3 or C4 electrodes , overlying the central sulcus , were used . No differences were found when using data derived from parietal and central electrodes in subjects where all channels were functional . To visualize spectrograms , a parametric autoregressive ( order of 1 ) whitening method was first applied to the data . For rodent data ( sampled at 1250 Hz ) and human data ( sampled at 256\u2013512 Hz ) , time-frequency decomposition was performed using analytic Gabor wavelet transform to enhance temporal resolution . Wavelet spectrograms centered at twitch times were normalized by z-scoring and averaged to obtain trigger-averaged spectrograms . Power was extracted for quantification from the magnitude of the analytic Gabor wavelet transform . Epochs of oscillatory activity were defined by presence of rectified signal amplitude above the 99th percentile of the wideband noise floor . To measure periodic and aperiodic properties of human neural data , power spectra were extracted using multi-taper method ( http:\/chronux . org ) and modeled using \u2018fitting oscillations and one over f\u2019 ( Corner and Kwee , 1976 ) . In order to quantify the changing tendency of each feature over time , we modeled the trends with linear and polynomial regression models . To find the optimal fit that most accurately represented the overall trend without overfitting , we used LOOCV to evaluate the models . The model with the minimum MSE was considered to have the best fit . When model fit predicted existence of local extrema , we used bootstrapping to estimate the location of these extrema for the trajectory of each property we investigated . For animal data , we resampled with replacement within each day from P5 to P14 . For human data , we resampled within each 1\u20132 weeks . Age was jittered with a window of 0 . 5 days and 0 . 5 weeks for animal and human data , respectively , to aid with fitting . We found the age corresponding to the first peak or trough of the regression line across development . This process was repeated 10 , 000 times to generate a probability distribution of location of local extrema across the developmental trajectory . The same process was repeated using resampling with replacement across all timepoints of the trajectory ( 10 , 000 iterations ) to generate a null distribution for comparison . Spindle band oscillations were detected based on wavelet-derived power and duration parameters . Intervals of oscillatory activity containing spindle band power were first detected and a ratio of normalized autoregressive wavelet ( Gabor ) -based\u00a0PAR was then calculated to identify discrete spindle band oscillations . Oscillatory intervals were detected by comparing the spindle band power ( Pspi ) of 8\u201325 Hz with threshold . Thresholds were determined relative to median absolute deviation ( median ( |Pspi| ) 0 . 6745 ) in the sleep intervals . Because this value varied markedly across development , thresholds were derived empirically but kept consistent across each age group . The value was decreased for silicon probe recordings in P5\u20137 pups compared to NeuroGrid recordings to maintain consistent detection despite quantifiably different signal to noise ratio . PAR\u00a0was then calculated based on the following equation:PAR=Pspi- ( Plow+Phigh ) Pspi+Plow+Phighwhere spindle band power ( Pspi ) was based on 8\u201325 Hz , low band power was based on 1\u20135 Hz ( Plow ) , and high band power was based on 30\u201380 Hz ( Phigh ) . Spindle band events were identified when the ratio crossed \u20130 . 1 for a minimum of 300 ms and a maximum of 5 s and had a peak greater than 0 . All detections were visually inspected for accuracy for each recording session and independently verified by an analyst blinded to detection parameters . In human EEG data , spindle band oscillations were detected across all channels as in mice , using a constant threshold relative to median absolute deviation ( median ( |Pspi| ) 0 . 6745 ) in the intervals of quiet\/NREM sleep and PAR was calculated as above . For subjects aged less than 40 weeks , the low band power was based on 2\u20136 Hz to aid with accurate detection of delta brushes . The channel with maximal oscillation power in the spindle band was selected for further analysis . Spindle band oscillations were characterized by their power , spatial extent , and spindle asymmetry ( Cole and Voytek , 2017 ) . Power was calculated by bandpass filtering each spindle band oscillation between 8\u00a0and\u00a025 Hz . We then calculated the rectified value of Hilbert transformed filtered signals to derive the power envelopes . The median value of each spindle band oscillation was defined as its power . Spatial extent was calculated by determining the number of channels simultaneous expressing spindle band oscillations with a manually selected channel located in primary somatosensory cortex for mice and the channel with the highest spindle band power for humans ( intersection of spindle start and end points > 300 ms and separation of spindle midpoints \u2264 50 ms on channels being compared ) . The spatial extent was expressed as a ratio of the number of channels with simultaneous occurrence and the total number of functional channels on the NeuroGrid . Data used for these calculations had a similar proportion and placement of channels located within primary somatosensory cortex . To quantify the sharpness of each spindle band oscillation\u2019s peak and trough , they were first broadly bandpass filtered at 5\u201330 Hz . Rising and falling zero-crossing points were identified . Peaks were recognized as the maximum timepoint in raw data between a rising zero-crossing point and a falling zero-crossing point; troughs were recognized as the minimum timepoint in raw data between a rising zero-crossing point and a falling zero-crossing point . Sharpness of a peak was defined as the mean difference between the voltage at the oscillatory peak Vpeak and the voltage at timepoints before ( Vbefore ) and after the peak ( Vafter ) , where the timepoint corresponded to a phase shift of approximately \u03c0 ( 8 ms ) . Trough sharpness was defined similarly:Sharppeak=Vpeak-Vbefore+ ( Vpeak-Vafter ) 2Sharptrough=Vbefore-Vtrough+ ( Vafter-Vtrough ) 2 As the absolute difference between the extrema and the surrounding timepoints increases , the extrema sharpness increases . Extrema mean sharpness ratios ( ESR ) were calculated as a metric to quantify the sharpness asymmetry of each spindle . The ESR was defined in the following manner:ESR=1Npeaks\u2211peakssharppeak1Ntroughs\u2211troughssharptrough Larger deviation from 1 indicated greater sharpness asymmetry of the spindle . Spectral analysis of the data was performed , and any data contaminated with electrical noise ( 60 Hz ) was eliminated from analysis to prevent spurious correlations . Comodulograms of cross-frequency coupling were computed based on a Gabor wavelet of raw data around the time of spindle band oscillation ( 4 s ) , followed by a Gaussian window convolution with duration matched to the frequency . The correlation matrix was calculated based on the magnitude of the wavelet components . Comparisons with p<0 . 05 after Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction for multiple comparisons were considered statistically significant . Columns of the correlation matrix corresponding to spindle band ( 10\u201320 Hz ) were extracted and summated to obtain a curve representing the magnitude of frequency coupling to this band . Each local maximum coupling value was detected along with its peak prominence ( how significant a peak is on account of its intrinsic value and location relative to other peaks ) and peak width ( frequency range with between half-prominence points ) . Peaks were thresholded based on prominence and width ( \u0394f < 1\/fc , peak prominence > 0 . 75 ) . Wide-band coupling index was calculated by ( peak value \u00d7 peak prominence ) \/peak width . AUC was calculated by integrated the summated coupling curves . Neural spiking was detected on each channel by thresholding negative peaks greater than four times the high-pass filtered noise floor during epochs of sleep . Coincident spike times across a greater distance than expected for physiological spike waveforms ( ~300 \u00b5m ) were presumed to be non-physiological and eliminated from all channels . Electrodes were allocated based on histology and electrophysiological characteristics into zones roughly corresponding to superficial ( I\u2013III ) and deep ( IV\u2013VI ) cortical layers . Electrodes from two non-contiguous sites ( >200 \u00b5m vertical separation ) within the deep cortical layers and one site from superficial cortical layers were used for subsequent analysis . Because individual neuron action potentials could potentially be detected on more than one channel , spikes occurring on different channels within the same histological zone < 2 ms apart were presumed to be duplicate detections and only the first spike was used for analysis . ISIs for the neural population were calculated as the absolute time between sorted spike times within the zone . A modified convolution method was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for population spike time autocorrelograms with a bin size of 10 ms . Peristimulus time histograms were calculated using a bin size of 50 ms with 95% confidence intervals determined from a shuffled distribution of spike times . To derive spike phase-locking to spindle band oscillations , the oscillatory epochs were first downsampled to 125 Hz and narrowly bandpass filtered at 9\u201316 Hz . Phase was extracted using Hilbert transform . Phase bins \u03c0\/24 were used for quantification of spike phase preference . Statistical analysis was performed using a combination of open-source MATLAB toolboxes and custom MATLAB code . A modified convolution method was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for correlograms . Significance of phase-locking to spindle band oscillations was determined using alpha < 0 . 05 with a corresponding kappa value of > 0 . 1 Kuiper test ( Circular Statistics Toolbox for MATLAB ) . Null distributions were generated based on 500 instances of data shuffling and used to calculate 95% confidence intervals . Probability distributions were compared using two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests with correction for multiple comparisons . Differences between groups were calculated using non-parametric rank-sum ( Wilcoxon ) or ANOVA ( Kruskal\u2013Wallis with Bonferroni correction ) depending on the nature of the data analyzed . When event size varied between groups , a random sample of events was selected from groups with larger event sizes to ensure group differences were not driven by degrees of freedom . Error bars represent standard error of mean . Testing was two-tailed and significance level was p<0 . 05 .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["neuroscience"],"id":"elife-69011-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"Many of our decisions are made on the basis of imperfect or \u2018noisy\u2019 information . A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to work out how such noise affects three aspects of decision-making: the accuracy ( or appropriateness ) of a choice , the speed at which the choice is made , and the decision-maker\u2019s confidence that they have chosen correctly . One theory of decision-making is that the brain simultaneously accumulates evidence for each of the options it is considering , until one option exceeds a threshold and is declared the \u2018winner\u2019 . This theory is known as bounded evidence accumulation . It predicts that increasing the noisiness of the available information decreases the accuracy of decisions made in response . Counterintuitively , it also predicts that such an increase in noise speeds up decision-making and increases confidence levels . Zylberberg et al . have now tested these predictions experimentally by getting human volunteers and monkeys to perform a series of trials where they had to decide whether a set of randomly moving dots moved to the left or to the right overall . Using a newly developed method , the noisiness of the dot motion could be changed between trials . The effectiveness of this technique was confirmed by recording the activity of neurons in the region of the monkey brain that processes visual motion information . After each trial , the humans rated their confidence in their decision . By comparison , the monkeys could indicate that they were not confident in a decision by opting for a guaranteed small reward on certain trials ( instead of the larger reward they received when they correctly indicated the direction of motion of the dots ) . In both humans and monkeys , increasing the noisiness associated with the movement of the dots led to faster and more confident decision-making , just as the bounded evidence accumulation framework predicts . Furthermore , the results presented by Zylberberg et al . suggest that the brain does not always gauge how reliable evidence is in order to fine-tune decisions . Now that the role of noise in decision-making is better understood , future experiments could attempt to reveal how artificial manipulations of the brain contribute both information and noise to a decision . Other experiments might ascertain when the brain can learn that noisy information should invite slower , more cautious decisions .","article":"Many decisions are thought to arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound . In perception , the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength , characterized by signal-to-noise ratio , on decision speed , accuracy and confidence . It also makes intriguing predictions about the noise itself . An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions , reduced accuracy and , paradoxically , higher confidence . To test these predictions , we introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex , which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT\/MST . For both humans and monkeys , increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired . The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model . \n Decisions that combine information from different sources or across time are of special interest to neuroscience because they serve as a model of cognitive function . These decisions are not hard wired or reflexive , yet they are experimentally tractable . Psychologists have long sought to understand how the process of decision formation gives rise to three key observables ( Cartwright and Festinger , 1943; Audley , 1960; Vickers , 1979 ) . First there is the choice itself ( left or right , coffee or tea ) , which determines accuracy in cases where a correct alternative can be defined . Second , there is the time it takes to reach a decision , which determines reaction-time ( RT ) . RT furnishes a powerful constraint on models of decision-making , and is a defining element of the trade-off between speed and accuracy that characterizes most decisions . Third , decisions are often accompanied by a graded degree of belief in the accuracy or appropriateness of the choice . This belief , referred to as decision confidence , influences many aspects of behavior: how we learn from our mistakes , plan subsequent decisions , and communicate our decisions to others . A model of the decision process ought to explain not just choices but all three of these observables in a quantitative fashion . The family of bounded evidence accumulation models , including drift diffusion , race and attractor models , offers one such framework for linking choice , reaction time and confidence [for reviews , see Gold and Shadlen ( 2007 ) ; Shadlen and Kiani ( 2013 ) ] . These models depict the decision process as a race between competing accumulators , each of which integrates momentary evidence for one alternative and against the others . The decision terminates when the accumulated evidence for one alternative , termed a decision variable ( DV ) , reaches a threshold or bound , thereby determining both the choice and the decision time . Confidence in the decision derives from a mapping between the DV and the probability that a decision based on this DV will be correct . The mapping is thought to incorporate the decision time or the state of the competing ( losing ) accumulator ( s ) , or both ( Vickers , 1979; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009; Zylberberg et al . , 2012; Kiani et al . , 2014; Van den Berg et al . , 2016 ) . The noisiness of the momentary evidence causes the DV to wander from its starting point , as in Brownian motion or diffusion , whereas the expectation ( i . e . , mean ) of the momentary evidence increments or decrements the DV deterministically . Noise is the main determinant of both RT and confidence when signal-to-noise is low , that is when choices are more stochastic ( less accurate ) . Recent evidence from neurophysiology ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) , brain stimulation ( Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) , and psychophysics ( Kiani et al . , 2014 ) supports such a mechanism . If the bounded accumulation of noisy evidence underlies choice accuracy , RT and confidence , then a selective manipulation of the noise should produce quantitatively consistent effects on all three measures . Specifically , were it possible to leave unchanged the expectation of each sample of momentary evidence while boosting the noise associated with it , then the bounded accumulation of the noisier samples should lead to ( i ) lower accuracy when the expectation of the momentary evidence is strong , ( ii ) faster reaction times when the momentary evidence is weak , and ( iii ) increased confidence when the momentary evidence is weak . The basic insight behind the latter two predictions is that with greater volatility , the DV tends to diffuse more quickly away from the starting point to achieve levels nearer the termination bound which are ordinarily associated with stronger evidence and thus greater confidence ( Figure 1 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 003Figure 1 . Predicted influence of volatility on reaction time and confidence under bounded evidence accumulation . ( A ) ev1 ( t ) and ev2 ( t ) represent the time course of momentary evidence , for stimuli of low and high volatility , respectively . In bounded accumulation models , momentary evidence is integrated over time , until the accumulated evidence ( decision variable , DV ) crosses one of two bounds , here at \u00b1 B . Bound-crossing simultaneously resolves the choice that is made and the time it takes to make it ( decision time; the reaction time also includes a nondecision component , not shown ) . With greater noise , the decision variable tends to diffuse more rapidly , leading to faster responses . ( B ) Illustration of the effect of volatility on the distribution of decision times , for two bounded accumulation models that have the same drifts and bound heights but different diffusion coefficients . As in the single trial example , higher variance leads to faster responses . ( C ) Heat map depicting the association between the state of accumulated evidence and the probability that a decision rendered on this evidence is correct . The structure in this graph arises because there are several difficulty levels . More reliable stimuli ( e . g . , high motion coherence ) , which support high accuracy , contribute to large vertical excursions of the decision variable away from the starting point ( midpoint of the ordinate ) at short elapsed time , whereas less reliable stimuli contribute to equivalent vertical excursions at later times . Example probability contours are depicted with dashed lines . Because the volatility of the stimulus is not explicitly represented in this map , higher volatility would lead to greater confidence , because the decision variable diffuses more quickly from the starting point , leading paradoxically to states that are normally associated with more reliable sources . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 003 These predictions have not been tested thoroughly , because a controlled method for selectively increasing noise is not known . A dissociation between accuracy and confidence led Rahnev et al . ( 2012 ) to conclude that transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) increased the neural noise associated with the representation of a visual pattern , and a similar dissociation led\u00a0Fetsch et al . ( 2014 ) to conclude that cortical microstimulation ( \u00b5Stim ) might affect both the mean and the variance of the representation of motion by neurons in the extrastriate visual cortex ( areas MT\/MST ) . However , characterization of these effects of TMS and \u00b5Stim was inferred from behavior . Similarly , psychophysical studies that attempted to increase the noise through changes in the visual stimulus ( de Gardelle and Summerfield , 2011; Zylberberg et al . , 2014; de Gardelle and Mamassian , 2015 ) or attentional state ( Rahnev et al . , 2011; Morales et al . , 2015 ) did not characterize the influence of these manipulations on the neural signals that the brain accumulates to form a decision . We therefore sought a method to manipulate the variance associated with the neural representation of momentary evidence without affecting its mean . We achieved this with a manipulation of the motion information in a random dot motion ( RDM ) display , by adding a second level of randomness which increased its volatility but was unbiased with respect to the strength and direction of motion evidence . We verified that the manipulation has the desired properties by recording from direction selective neurons in the middle temporal ( MT ) and medial superior temporal ( MST ) areas of the macaque visual cortex . Neurons in these areas are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks identical to those in our study ( Salzman et al . , 1990; Celebrini and Newsome , 1995; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) . We then used the volatility manipulation to test the influence of noise on the three observables of choice behavior\u2014accuracy , RT and confidence\u2014in monkeys and humans . \n The standard RDM stimulus is itself stochastic , meaning that a particular movie ( e . g . , shown on a trial ) is an instantiation of a random process that conforms to an expected motion strength and direction . On each video frame , a dot that had appeared \u2206t ms ago is either displaced ( i . e . , moved ) or replaced by a new dot at a random location within the stimulus aperture . The determination of displacement versus replacement is in accordance with a flip of a biased coin , and the magnitude of this bias confers the motion strength , which we refer to as a motion coherence ( c ) . The sign of c indicates the direction of the displacement along an axis ( e . g . , up\/down ) . Thus the probability of displacement ( or unfairness of the coin ) is |c| . The randomly replaced dots fall in the neighborhood of other dots ( recently displayed ) and thus contribute random motion in both directions . In the standard RDM , the coherence , c , is fixed for the duration of an experimental trial ( e . g . , c\u00a0=\u00a00 . 13; Figure 2A , left , blue line ) . Here we introduce a second layer of variability , wherein the mean of c is fixed for the duration of a trial but the value of c varies randomly from video frame to video frame ( Figure 2A , left , red line ) . We will refer to trials that employ this doubly stochastic RDM as the 'high volatility' condition and those that use the standard RDM as 'low volatility' . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 004Figure 2 . Doubly stochastic random dot motion selectively influences the variance of evidence . Low and high volatility conditions are indicated by blue and red , respectively , in all panels . ( A ) Motion strength as a function of time for example stimuli with low and high volatility . Left: the coherence parameter is 0 . 128 for both stimuli , but in the high volatility condition this is the mean of a Gaussian distribution ( S . D . = 0 . 256 ) that is sampled on every video frame ( 75 Hz ) . Right: motion energy in favor of the positive direction . Both volatility conditions yield variation in the motion information , but the red curve exhibits more variation . ( B ) Mean and variance of the motion energy in support of the true direction of motion , computed separately for trials of low and high volatility ( N\u00a0= 66 , 805 trials ) . For all motion strengths , the mean ( upper ) is not affected by the volatility manipulation , whereas the variance is larger in the high volatility condition . Note the log scale for both axes . ( C ) Mean and variance of the neuronal response from direction selective neurons in areas MT\/MST ( N = 26 single units and 21 multiunit sites; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Spike counts were obtained from a 100 ms window beginning 100 ms after stimulus onset and standardized ( z-score ) for each neuron or multiunit site . The volatility manipulation produced a small increase in the average firing rate at the low coherences ( upper ) . This increase is likely due to the rectification of the noise by the nonlinear response of the neuron to motion in the preferred and anti-preferred directions , as sketched in the inset . The variance parallels the mean , but volatility has a more marked effect on variance at weak motion strengths . Note the linear scales . ( D ) Mean and variance of a difference between opposing pools of neural signals . The graphs extrapolate from panel C by constructing two pools of 100 or more neurons sharing a common preferred or anti-preferred direction , respectively . The mean of the difference variable ( \u03bc\u0394 ) is similar for both volatility conditions ( upper ) , whereas the variance of the difference variable ( \u03c3\u03942 ) is greater under high volatility ( lower ) . This relationship is shown for three values of correlation ( \u03c1 ) between the pools which span the plausible range . The correlation is negative because the opposing pools respond oppositely to fluctuations in the motion stimulus .

In addition to the estimate of variance from neural recordings , we used a 3-parameter characterization of the noise as a function of volatility and motion strength . The example is from the fit to behavioral data from monkey W in the reaction-time task . See Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details . Note the similarity of this graph to the estimates derived from the neural recordings in Figure 2D ( lower panel ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 006 This description explains how the stimulus is generated , but it does not explain what effect it should have on perception or on the neural processing of motion . The construction of the RDM we use is in video frames displayed every 1\/75 of a second . The visual system blurs these images over time , leading for example to the illusion that many more dots are present simultaneously than are actually displayed . The right panel of Figure 2A applies an established motion filter ( Adelson and Bergen , 1985 ) to the example movies parameterized by the low and high volatility traces shown in the left panel ( see also Video 1 ) . The filter extracts a time-blurred motion signal that provides a reasonable approximation to the firing rates of direction selective neurons in the primate visual cortex ( Britten et al . , 1993; Rust et al . , 2006; Hedges et al . , 2011 ) . The example highlights the subtlety of the volatility manipulation by reminding us that the standard RDM is itself volatile ( blue curve ) such that the overall contour of both traces is similar . Nonetheless , the extra bumps and wiggles in the red trace result from the random variation in c . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 007Video 1 . Example motion stimuli . The movie shows the low and high volatility examples depicted in Figure 2A . For illustration purposes , before showing the moving dots we indicate the coherence , volatility and direction of motion . These were not displayed to the participants in the experiment . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 007 A more systematic analysis of the motion energy , displayed in Figure 2B , reveals that the mean is identical for low and high volatility stimuli , for all motion strengths ( upper panel ) , whereas the variance is larger for the high volatility stimuli ( lower panel ) . The linear relationship between the mean motion energy and c is known ( Britten et al . , 1993 ) , but the dependency of variance of the motion energy on c is less well characterized . For the low volatility condition ( Figure 2B bottom , blue trace ) , the motion energy variance is dominated by the variance in the number of coherently displaced dots , which obeys a binomial distribution , hence the monotonic increase over the range of |c| = 0 to 0 . 5 . For the high volatility condition ( Figure 2B bottom , red trace ) , the overall increase in variance is not surprising , because we have added a second layer of variability . Note that the effect is strongest at the low coherences , where the distribution of c in the high volatility condition spans both positive and negative values . These observations characterize the volatility present in the visual stimulus , but we are mainly interested in the noisy signals that the brain accumulates to form a decision . We therefore measured the impact of volatility on the response of direction selective neurons in cortical areas MT\/MST ( Figure 2C ) . These neurons represent the momentary evidence used by monkeys to guide their choice , reaction time and confidence ( Salzman et al . , 1990; Celebrini and Newsome , 1995; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) in motion discrimination tasks . As previously shown ( Britten et al . , 1993 ) , the firing rate of MT neurons increases linearly , on average , as a function of motion strength in the neuron\u2019s preferred direction ( c\u00a0>\u00a00 , Figure 2C , upper panel , blue trace ) . The firing rate decreases linearly , but less steeply , as a function of motion strength in the anti-preferred direction ( c\u00a0<\u00a00 ) , giving rise to a bilinear function . We refer to the shallower slope for c\u00a0<\u00a00 as rectification ( Britten et al . , 1993 ) . These features are preserved under high volatility ( red trace ) , but there is a subtle increase in firing rate at the low coherences , which is explained by the rectification of neural responses when the distribution of c spans positive and negative values ( Figure 2C , inset ) . The variance of the neural response is known to scale approximately linearly with firing rate ( Tolhurst et al . , 1983; Vogels et al . , 1989; Geisler and Albrecht , 1997; Shadlen and Newsome , 1998 ) . Thus the variance curves in Figure 2C ( lower panel ) parallel the means . The high volatility condition adds to the variance in a manner that is exaggerated at the low motion strengths , consistent with the motion energy analysis above . We are now ready to consider the mean and variance of the quantity that is integrated toward a decision . We assume that the momentary evidence is the difference between the average firing rates from two pools of neurons with direction preferences for the two opposite directions ( e . g . , right-preferring minus left-preferring ) ( Shadlen et al . , 1996; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Hanks et al . , 2006 ) . The expectation of this signal can be estimated empirically by subtracting the mean firing rates of single neurons to motion in their preferred versus anti-preferred directions ( Figure 2D ) . Notice that the rectification is now canceled by the subtraction . The variance of this difference is more nuanced , drawing on two related considerations . First , because we did not record multiple single units simultaneously , we are not directly measuring the variance of the pools . Assuming a population of correlated neurons , the variance of the population mean differs from that of a single neuron by a multiplicative constant . For large pools , the variance is reduced to roughly r\u03c32 , where r is the average pairwise spike-count correlation for neurons within the pool and \u03c32 is the variance of the spike counts from a single neuron ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . In MT , r is on the order of 0 . 2 for neurons with similar directional preferences ( Zohary et al . , 1994; Bair et al . , 2001 ) . An important implication of such correlation is that the beneficial effects of pooling saturate with modest number of neurons ( e . g . , 50\u2013100; [Zohary et al . , 1994; Shadlen et al . , 1996] ) . Second , the variance of the MT population comprises contributions from the variance in motion energy , described above , as well as a component that is independent of stimulus fluctuations . The opposing pool is assumed to share the component of variance originating in the stimulus , albeit of opposite sign , so the variances add rather than cancel in the difference . In contrast , the stimulus-independent component of shared variance ( e . g . , driven by fluctuations of arousal ) should have the same sign in the two pools and thus cancel in the difference . For a given coherence c and volatility v , the variance of the difference in neuronal response between a pair of populations selective to the preferred and anti-preferred directions is given by: ( 1 ) \u03c3\u0394|c , v2=r ( \u03c3c , v2+\u03c3\u2212c , v2\u22122\u03c1\u03c3c , v\u03c3\u2212c , v ) , where \u03c3c , v2 and \u03c3\u2212c , v2 are the variance of the spike counts for motion in the preferred and anti-preferred directions , r is the average pairwise correlation for neurons within the same pool , and \u03c1 is the correlation between the two pools with opposite direction preferences . The variances on the right-hand side of Equation 1 can be obtained from Figure 2C . However , without simultaneous recordings from neurons in the two pools , we cannot know how much of the variability is shared across neurons . In Figure 2D we explored three different values of \u03c1: 0 , \u22120 . 5 and \u22121 ( with r=0 . 2 ) . Note that positive values of \u03c1 are unlikely because a large portion of the shared variability comes from stimulus fluctuations , which as stated above induce changes in firing rate of opposite sign in the two pools . Under the low volatility condition , the variance of the difference variable increases slightly as a function of motion strength . This is a consequence of rectification and the tendency for variance to parallel the mean firing rate . More importantly , the doubly stochastic stimuli lead to a marked increase in \u03c3\u03942 , especially in the low coherence range where the impact on motion energy is greatest . This effect did not depend on the value of \u03c1 ( Figure 2D ) . From these complementary analyses of stimulus and neural response , we conclude that the volatility manipulation has negligible effects on the expectation of momentary evidence and more substantial effects on the variance , especially at weak motion strengths . This enables us to proceed with a critical test of the bounded accumulation framework . In what follows we attempt to ascertain whether a change in the variance of the momentary evidence , introduced by our volatility manipulation , affects decision speed , accuracy , and confidence in accordance with the predictions of bounded evidence accumulation . One monkey ( monkey W ) and three humans were required to decide between two possible directions of motion and , when ready , to indicate their decision by looking to one of two targets ( Figure 3A ) . For both high and low volatility conditions , stronger motion led to faster and more accurate choices . The main effect of high volatility was to decrease RTs , particularly at the weakest motion strengths ( Figure 3B , bottom row , red ) . This effect was robust for all three human subjects and the monkey ( Equation 16 , all p<0 . 03 , t-test , H0: \u03b22=0 ) . The manipulation affected the accuracy only subtly , and this was not statistically reliable for individual subjects in the RT task ( Figure 3B , top row; for the four subjects: p=[0 . 35 , 0 . 65 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 26] , Equation 17 , likelihood-ratio test ) . However , there was a significant effect of volatility on accuracy when pooling data across subjects and including data from the confidence tasks described below ( Equation 18 , p<0 . 0005 , likelihood ratio test , H0: \u03b22=0; see also Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 008Figure 3 .

They could report their decisions at any time after the onset of motion . Trials of different coherences and volatilities were randomly interleaved . ( B ) Decision speed and accuracy .

Although the volatility manipulation led to only a subtle reduction in overall accuracy , which was not statistically reliable , we believe this is because the volatility manipulation was attenuated at intermediate and strong motion strengths ( Figure 2 ) . Nevertheless , a small reduction in accuracy is apparent when examining only these intermediate and higher coherences . ( A ) For the data from the RT task , the scatter plot shows the average accuracy for low vs . high volatility . Each point represents a particular combination of subject and motion strength . The 0% and 51 . 2% coherences are not shown . Errors bars represent s . e . ( B ) Same as A , but including trials from all experiments ( RT , PDW and human confidence tasks ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 010 The pattern of results in Figure 3B is consistent with the hypothesis that decisions are made when an accumulation of noisy evidence reaches a bound . Indeed , the smooth curves are fits of this model to the data , where the variance of the momentary evidence is the only parameter that we allowed to change between conditions of high and low volatility ( see below ) . The effect of increased volatility on RT is most apparent at motion strengths near zero , for two reasons: ( i ) the volatility manipulation has a larger impact on variance of the motion energy at the weak motion strengths ( Figure 2B ) , and ( ii ) the time to reach a bound is dominated by the variance of the momentary evidence , \u03c3\u03942 , when the motion strength is weak . For instance , when c\u00a0=\u00a00 , the average time required by a diffusion process to reach a bound is proportional to \u03c3\u0394\u22122 ( Shadlen et al . , 2006 ) . These considerations also help to reconcile the contrast between the striking effects of volatility on RT versus subtle effects on choice accuracy: the volatility manipulation mainly affects the weakest motion strengths where accuracy is already poor ( but see Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The important point is that by increasing noise , the volatility manipulation accelerates the dispersion of the decision variable away from its expected value and nearer the termination bounds , hence faster RT . A similar idea guides intuitions about the effect of volatility on confidence in a decision . Confidence refers to the belief that a decision one is about to make ( or has just made ) is likely to be correct . In the framework of bounded evidence accumulation , it can be formalized as the conditional probability of a correct choice given the state of the DV , which comprises the accumulated evidence and elapsed decision time ( Equation 5 ) . For the motion discrimination task , this can be calculated by considering , for each possible state of the DV , the likelihood that it was the result of motion strength of the appropriate sign . We refer to this as a mapping between DV and probability correct ( Figure 1C ) . It depends on the set of possible motion strengths ( the prior distribution of c ) , the two possible volatility conditions , and the amount of time that has elapsed in the trial . We assume the subject has implicit knowledge of this mapping , and does not adjust it when a low or high volatility stimulus is shown . The latter seems justified because volatility levels were randomly interleaved and not cued or even mentioned to the subjects ( we evaluate this assumption , below , in several alternative models ) . Increased volatility should affect confidence because it mimics an increase in the diffusion rate . At low coherences in particular , its main effect on the DV is to accelerate its exodus away from neutral ( probability correct = 0 . 5 ) to more extreme values . Therefore , we predicted that volatility would increase confidence at low coherences , for the same reason that it speeds the RT . To test this prediction , we used two variants of the motion task , tailored to the abilities of monkeys and humans . Monkey D was trained on a motion discrimination task with post-decision wagering ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) ( PDW; Figure 4A ) . The monkey had to decide between two opposite directions of motion and report its decision after a memory delay . The monkey was rewarded for correct decisions and randomly on the 0% coherence trials . On half of the trials , the monkey had the opportunity to opt out of reporting the direction choice and to select instead a smaller but certain reward . The 'sure bet' option was not revealed until at least one-half second after motion offset ( i . e . , during the delay ) . The task design thus encouraged the monkey to perform the direction discrimination on every trial . After extensive experience with the standard RDM ( >100 , 000 trials; low volatility condition ) , we introduced the high volatility RDM on a random half of the trials . Single- and multi-unit recordings during performance of this task furnished the data for Figure 2C\u2013D , as well as additional neurophysiological analyses described later . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 011Figure 4 . Effect of volatility on post-decision wagering . ( A ) Task . The monkey viewed the motion display for random duration , controlled by the computer , followed by a memory-delay period . When the fixation point was extinguished , the monkey indicated the net direction of motion by making an eye movement to a left or right choice target in order to receive a liquid reward , if correct . On a random half of trials , the monkey was presented a third \u2018sure bet\u2019 option ( red target ) during the delay period , which if chosen resulted in a small but certain reward . ( B ) Decision confidence and accuracy . Volatility did not affect accuracy systematically ( upper ) , but the monkey waived the sure bet option more often on trials employing the high volatility display ( lower ) , indicating greater confidence . The effect was concentrated at weak and intermediate motion strengths . Standard errors are shown but are smaller than the symbols .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 013 In both low and high volatility conditions , the monkey made rational use of the sure bet , opting out more often for weaker motion ( Equation 19 , p<10\u20136 , logistic regression , likelihood-ratio test; Figure 4B ) and for briefer stimuli ( Equation 19 , p<10\u20136 , logistic regression; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . When the sure bet was offered but waived , choice accuracy was higher than when the sure bet was not offered ( Equation 20 , p<10\u20136 , logistic regression; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This indicates that the monkey was more likely to opt out of rendering its decision when the answer was more likely to be wrong . It implies that the decision to accept or waive the sure bet is based on the state of the evidence on the trial and not a general propensity associated with each motion strength ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . The main question we wished to address is whether the high volatility condition would elicit fewer sure-bet choices , consistent with greater confidence . As shown in Figure 4B ( lower panel ) , the proportion of trials the monkey decided to waive the sure-bet option ( deciding instead for a riskier direction choice ) was greater on the high volatility trials ( Equation 19 , p<10\u20136 , likelihood-ratio test ) . Thus , high volatility increased the monkey\u2019s confidence , and did so despite a negligible effect on accuracy ( Figure 4B , upper ) . Further , like its effect on RT , volatility affected PDW mainly when the motion was weak ( Figure 4B , lower ) . We confirmed the relationship between volatility and confidence in human participants . Instead of using PDW , we asked subjects to report their confidence on a scale from \u201cfeels like I\u2019m guessing\u201d to \u201ccertain I\u2019m correct . \u201d The same three observers that performed the reaction time task participated in this second experiment . The RDM ( low or high volatility , randomly interleaved ) was displayed for a fixed 200 ms on each trial , after which they reported the perceived direction of motion ( left or right ) and the confidence in their decision . Participants reported the choice and the confidence rating by looking at a particular position on one of two elongated targets ( Figure 5A ) , where the left or right target specified the motion choice and the vertical position was used to indicate confidence . They were allowed to adjust their gaze to the desired level before finalizing their combined choice and confidence report ( Figure 5A ) . We thus encouraged subjects to use all available information in the 200 ms stimulus for both reports ( Van den Berg et al . , 2016 ) . The results from the human observers were similar to those from the monkey . Naturally , subjects were more confident for high coherence stimuli ( Equation 21 , p<10\u20136 , t-test; Figure 5 ) . They also reported higher confidence for the high volatility stimuli , and the effect was most apparent for the low coherence stimuli ( Equation 21 , p<0 . 0004 , t-test ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 014Figure 5 .

Decision confidence and accuracy in the human confidence task . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 015 So far , the effect of volatility has been described qualitatively . Now we show how a single bounded accumulation model can account for the combined effect of motion strength and volatility on choice , accuracy and RT . In the model , choice , RT and confidence result from the accumulation of noisy momentary evidence as a function of time , until the integral of the evidence ( the decision variable , DV ) reaches one of two bounds , or for the PDW and confidence tasks , until the stimulus is curtailed . In the latter case , the sign of the DV determines the choice . The DV is updated at each time step by the addition of a constant , proportional to motion strength , plus a draw from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution . In the language of drift-diffusion , the former gives rise to deterministic drift and the latter to a Wiener process scaled by a diffusion coefficient . The noise is itself comprised of stochastic contributions from the stimulus and its neural representation . Many studies make the simplifying assumption that the variance of the momentary evidence is fixed and independent of motion strength ( Ditterich et al . , 2003; Palmer et al . , 2005; Shadlen et al . , 2006 ) . This would be the case if the momentary evidence obeyed the idealization in Figure 2B and if the neural responses of rightward and leftward preferring neurons exhibited variance that scaled linearly with mean . Then the difference between population responses would have the same variance for all motion strengths . However , the partial rectification ( Figure 2C ) implies that the variance of the difference should increase as a function of motion strength . We characterize the dependency of the diffusion coefficient on motion strength and volatility based on the empirical observations of Figure 2 . These analyses showed that ( i ) the variance of the momentary evidence increases with motion strength , and ( ii ) the difference in noise between volatility conditions is larger at 0% coherence and decays gradually for stronger motion . We capture these observations with a simple parameterization of the diffusion coefficient ( Equations 2 and 3 ) . First , we assumed that in the low volatility condition , the variance of the momentary evidence increases linearly with motion strength ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , blue trace; note the log scale of the abscissa ) . Second , we modeled the additional variability introduced by the doubly-stochastic manipulation as a variance offset at 0% coherence that decays exponentially as motion strength increases ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , red trace ) . The framework can explain confidence if we assume that the brain has implicit knowledge of ( i ) the state of the accumulated evidence , ( ii ) the elapsed deliberation time , and ( iii ) the mapping of time and evidence to the probability of making a correct choice ( Figure 1C ) . Time matters because the same level of accumulated evidence is associated with lower levels of accuracy if the evidence was accrued over longer periods of time ( Figure 1C ) . In PDW , a sure-bet choice supersedes a direction decision if the probability correct ( estimated from the state of accumulated evidence and the decision time ) is lower than a criterion \u03a6 . In the human confidence task , probability correct is transformed into a confidence rating through a monotonic transformation ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . The solid curves in Figures 3\u20135 are model fits . The model was fit to maximize the likelihood of the observables ( choice and RT in the reaction time task; choice and sure bet in PDW ) . Best-fitting parameters are shown in Table 1 . In the confidence task , we fit one parameter per subject ( \u03ba; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . This parameter was fit to maximize the likelihood of the direction choices . All other parameters were taken from the RT task , performed by the same participants . Therefore , the confidence curves in Figure 5B can be considered predictions of the model . These predictions capture the trend well , supporting the notion that time and accumulated evidence are the main determinants of confidence in a perceptual choice , even when noise is under experimental control . The overall quality of the fits\u2014across all tasks and both species\u2014indicates that the influence of motion strength and volatility on choice , reaction time and confidence can be explained by a common mechanism of bounded evidence accumulation . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 016Table 1 .

Up to now , we have attempted to explain the data on the assumption that subjects apply the same mapping between the accumulated evidence ( the DV ) and the probability that a decision rendered upon that evidence will be correct ( i . e . , confidence ) , regardless of the volatility condition . As stated earlier , the mapping is derived from all possible motion strengths , directions , and volatility conditions . Thus , we assume that subjects do not infer the noisiness of incoming evidence , or that if they do , they do not revise the mapping accordingly . An alternative is that the brain infers an estimate of the noisiness of the stimulus , in real time , to adjust the parameters of the decision process ( Deneve , 2012; Qamar et al . , 2013 ) or the evaluation of confidence ( Yeung and Summerfield , 2012 ) . This is a reasonable proposition , at least in principle , because the sample mean and variance of the motion energy can be used to classify volatility conditions with 90% accuracy ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . We evaluated several 'two map' models which apply a different mapping between the DV and probability correct for each volatility condition . The first two-map model implements the assumption that subjects have full and immediate knowledge of the volatility condition on each trial . Although the maps are qualitatively similar ( compare the iso-confidence contours of Figure 6A ) , the consequence of having separate maps is to reduce the effect of volatility on confidence . When fit to data , this two-map model produces visibly worse fits than the model that relies on a common map , despite having the same number of parameters ( Figure 6B; \u2206BIC\u00a0=\u00a0252 . 4 favoring the common-map model; see Table 2 for parameter fits ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 017Figure 6 .

For the second two-map model , the assessment of volatility is not instantaneous but evolves over the course of a trial . For simplicity , we assumed that the probability of correctly identifying the volatility condition increases monotonically at a rate determined by a free parameter ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Interestingly , the rate estimated from the best fit is exceedingly slow . For example , after 1 s of viewing , the weight assigned to the appropriate volatility map is just 1% . In other words , the confidence is dominated by the common mapping , consistent with our assumption . The fit is indistinguishable from the common-map model depicted in Figure 4 ( see Table 2 ) , and the BIC statistic revealed that the addition of the extra parameter was not justified ( \u2206BIC = 7 . 24 ) . We also considered the possibility that subjects used different termination criteria ( bound heights ) on low and high volatility trials . For the PDW task , this amounts to the addition of an extra free parameter in the first two-map model above . This model was also inferior to the simpler common-map model ( \u2206BIC\u00a0=\u00a0127; see Table 2 for parameter fits ) . This is not surprising because in the PDW task , stimulus duration is controlled by the experimenter , and bounds merely curtail the expected improvement in accuracy on longer duration stimuli . We also fit a model for the RT task that allowed the bounds to be different for the two volatility conditions . This led to a marginal increase in the likelihoods , but not enough to justify the addition of the extra parameter ( \u2206BIC = [29 . 4 , 7 . 7 , 27 . 3 , 12 . 1] for the four subjects; Table 2 ) . These analyses of alternative models support our assumption that subjects applied a common mapping and decision strategy on trials of low and high volatility . We do not believe this holds generally but is likely a consequence of the particular volatility manipulation and task designs we employed . Indeed , the normative strategy for several model tasks , which approximate those in our study , would apply different bounds and mappings to the two volatility conditions ( see Appendix ) . The full normative solution for the tasks we used is not known . Hence , we do not know if our subjects performed suboptimally or if they were simply unable to identify the volatility conditions without adding additional costs ( e . g . , effort and\/or time ) . The role of the neural data in this study was to validate and characterize the volatility manipulation in a population of neurons known to represent the momentary evidence used to inform decisions and confidence ( Salzman et al . , 1990; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Hanks et al . , 2006; Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , there are features of this limited data set which are germane to findings associated with the confidence task in particular . We share them in Figure 7 , accompanied by the proviso that the data set is limited . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 019Figure 7 . Trial-to-trial covariation between neural activity and behavior . ( A ) Average of the firing rate residuals , sorted by choice . The residuals are obtained by subtracting the average response to each motion strength and direction from the smoothed single-trial response . Positive values denote higher than average activity in support of the chosen alternative . Separate averages are shown for low ( blue ) and high ( red ) volatility trials . The vertical arrows show the time when the curves first differ from baseline , estimated with a curve-fitting procedure ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . The associated horizontal lines are \u00b1 one standard error of the latency estimates ( bootstrap ) . Shading shows \u00b1 1 s . e . m . across trials . ( B ) Difference in firing rate between the response to the preferred and the anti-preferred direction , for high-coherence trials . Trials of low and high volatility are shown in blue and red , respectively . Error bars represent s . e . m . across neurons . ( C ) Average of the firing rate residuals for trials in which the sure-bet target was chosen . For statistical power , we grouped trials from both volatility conditions . Neural responses are lower than average when the correct target is in the neurons\u2019 preferred direction ( positive coherences , magenta ) , and above average when the motion is in the non-preferred direction ( negative coherences , indigo ) . The arrow indicates the time at which the average residuals become significantly different from each other . ( D ) Average firing rate residuals sorted by choice , shown separately for trials where the sure bet was ( green ) or was not ( orange ) available . The average is greater when the sure bet was available but waived , consistent with the notion that the monkey waives the sure-bet target more often when the evidence appears to be stronger . The latency estimate ( arrow ) indicates the time that the difference between the curves becomes significant , which is similar to the time at which the neural activity is informative of the monkey\u2019s choice ( A ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17688 . 019 Consistent with earlier reports ( Britten et al . , 1992 ) , trial to trial variation in the activity of neurons in MT\/MST were indicative of the choice that the monkey was about to make . Figure 7A shows averaged residual responses , formed by subtracting the mean response for each motion strength as a function of time and multiplying by \u00b11 if the monkey chose the preferred of anti-preferred direction , respectively . Positive residuals therefore indicate an excess of activity in the chosen direction . For both low and high volatility conditions , trial-to-trial variation in the neural response was reflected in the monkey\u2019s choices . The fluctuations were more informative in the high volatility condition , presumably because they were induced by exaggerated variance in the motion display itself ( e . g . , Figure 2A ) . Notably , the time course of choice-related signals evolved with similar latencies in the low and high volatility conditions . The latencies were comparable to that of the direction selective signal itself ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that the choice was informed by the earliest motion information available in the stimulus ( Kiani et al . , 2008 ) . The influence of neural variation declines over 200 ms , consistent with the idea that the brain terminates some decisions before the end of the stimulus presentation ( Kiani et al . , 2008 ) . The trial-by-trial variation in neural activity was also correlated with the decision to accept or waive the sure-bet option , when it was offered . Monkeys should opt out of the direction decision when the evidence is weak , and waive the sure bet when the evidence is strong . For positive coherences ( i . e . , net motion in the preferred direction ) , the residuals of firing rate were on average negative ( Figure 7C , magenta trace ) . This implies that the monkey tended to opt out of the direction decision when the neural representation of the evidence was weaker than average . For negative coherences ( net motion in the non-preferred direction ) , the residuals were positive on average ( Figure 7C , blue trace ) , for an analogous reason . The difference between the two traces furnishes an estimate of the time course over which MT\/MST neurons inform the decision to opt out . Notice the similarity in the time course of the choice and confidence signals ( compare Figure 7A and C ) . The latency estimate derived from Figure 7C was unreliable ( arrow and horizontal error bar , Figure 7C ) , but it was corroborated by a complementary analysis of the trials in which the monkey waived the sure bet ( Figure 7D ) . Here we compared the average firing rate residuals on trials when the monkey waived the sure-bet option ( green trace ) with those on trials when the sure bet was not available ( orange trace ) . We expect these traces to differ if the monkey waves the sure bet on trials when the neural responses are stronger . The point of divergence of the two traces in Figure 7D furnishes a more reliable estimate of the latency with which confidence signals are represented in the neuronal response ( arrow ) . These results indicate that early motion evidence simultaneously informs both choice and confidence ( Zylberberg et al . , 2012 ) . They are inconsistent with the proposal that choice and confidence are resolved in strict succession , as these predict that confidence selectivity ought to emerge later than choice-related signals ( Pleskac and Busemeyer , 2010; Navajas et al . , 2016 ) . \n We have shown that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision\u2014what we term volatility\u2014increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it . Testing the influence of volatility on the decision process is difficult , because it requires independent control over the signal and the noise in the evidence . We mimicked a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus . Our approach differs from recent studies that have attempted to vary evidence reliability through stimulus manipulations ( de Gardelle and Summerfield , 2011; Zylberberg et al . , 2014; de Gardelle and Mamassian , 2015 ) in that we ( i ) applied the manipulation to a well studied motion task for which much is known about the underlying physiology; ( ii ) verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque , and ( iii ) showed how a framework based on the bounded accumulation of evidence can account for the joint effect of volatility on choice , reaction time and confidence . The modeling framework pursued here was able to explain the observed pattern of choices , RTs and confidence in a quantitatively coherent way ( Figures 3\u20135 ) , even predicting subjects\u2019 confidence ratings ( Figure 5B ) based on a fit to their RT data from a separate experiment ( Figure 3B ) . The intuition is that increased volatility disperses the decision variable away from its expectation . For low coherences , it accelerates departure from the starting point ( i . e . , neutral evidence ) and closer to one of the decision bounds . This tendency to arrive at larger absolute values of accumulated evidence\u2014in support of either choice\u2014leads to faster and more confident decisions ( Zylberberg et al . , 2012; Maniscalco et al . , 2016 ) . The intuition would apply to any theoretical framework that would associate confidence with the absolute deviation of a DV from neutral . This includes models based on signal detection theory ( Clarke et al . , 1959; Ferrell and McGoey , 1980; Macmillan and Creelman , 2004; Kepecs and Mainen , 2012; Fleming and Lau , 2014 ) ; however , these models ignore the temporal domain and are thus unable to account for RT or the strong correlation between deliberation time and confidence ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ( Henmon , 1911; Pierrel and Murray , 1963; Vickers et al . , 1985; Link , 1992; Kiani et al . , 2014 ) . These intuitions and our fits to the data rest on the assumption that subjects do not change their decision strategy based on the volatility of the evidence on a particular trial . On all trials , we assumed subjects applied the same termination policy ( i . e . , decision bound ) and the same mapping between the state of the evidence and confidence , for both volatility conditions as well as for all motion strengths ( Gorea and Sagi , 2000; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . We considered and rejected alternative models in which the brain uses volatility to adjust the mapping and\/or the decision bound . In particular , if different mappings between DV and confidence were used for the low and high volatility conditions , a larger excursion of the DV would be required in the high volatility condition to reach the same level of confidence , predicting a pattern of post-decision wagering behavior that was not supported by our data ( Figure 6 ) . In the RT task , volatility could be used to adjust the height of the decision bound in the face of lower reliability in order to maximize reward rate ( Deneve , 2012; Drugowitsch et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , the normative solution for a simplified version of the RT task is to increase the bound height on high volatility trials , which nevertheless leads to slightly faster responses than for low volatility trials when the motion is weak ( Appendix 1\u2014figure 1 ) . However , this idea presupposes knowledge of reliability on the trials , which ought to predict lower confidence in the high volatility condition . Thus , models that posit an online estimation of reliability [cf . , Deneve ( 2012 ) ; Yeung and Summerfield ( 2012 ) ; Qamar et al . ( 2013 ) ] make predictions that run counter to one or more of the trends we observed . This does not mean humans and monkeys are incapable of using information about stimulus reliability or difficulty to adjust their decision policy , and perhaps they would have in other circumstances ( Qamar et al . , 2013; Shen and Ma , 2016 ) . For instance , had we used only a very difficult and a very easy condition , there would be a stronger incentive to ascertain the difficulty of the decision online and use different termination criteria for each condition . However , our experiment\u2014in particular , the mixture of interleaved motion strengths and the volatility manipulation\u2014is representative of a broad class of decisions for which the reliability of the evidence is unknown to the decision-maker before beginning deliberation and not readily apparent from a small number of samples . In such circumstances , an estimate of reliability might be viewed as another decision , which would entail ( i ) specification of alternative hypotheses about reliability , ( ii ) defining which stimulus features constitute evidence bearing on these hypotheses , ( iii ) accumulating the relevant evidence , and ( iv ) specifying a termination criterion for this decision . Such an evaluation must balance the benefits derived from the use of reliability to adjust the parameters of the decision process trial by trial , with the associated cost in time and effort . Even if subjects were cued explicitly about reliability , it is not clear that they would adjust the decision criteria on a trial-by-trial basis . In a detection task where the stimulus categories were signaled by an external cue , human subjects did not adjust the decision criterion to the levels used when each stimulus category was presented on its own ( Gorea and Sagi , 2000 ) . Instead , subjects behaved as if they assumed a common distribution of signals encompassing all stimulus conditions and applied a single decision criterion . Our volatility manipulation was more subtle than an explicit cue , but we do not doubt that our subjects could perform above chance in a 2AFC experiment if they were trained to identify the higher volatility stimulus among a pair sharing the same motion strength . If nothing else , they could monitor their own decision times and confidence . However , when a mixture of different levels of volatility are presented in a sequence of otherwise similar events ( trials ) , subjects appear to combine trials of low and high volatility to form a single internal distribution with signed coherence as the only relevant dimension . Our results highlight limitations to the brain\u2019s capacity to extract and exploit knowledge of volatility . Our study may therefore be of interest to psychologists and behavioral economists ( d' Acremont and Bossaerts , 2016 ) . Systems with multiple interacting units , like financial markets , sometimes give rise to 'leptokurtic' distributions , referred to as those where the probability of extreme events is larger than expected from normal distributions ( Mandelbrot , 1997 ) . A simple way of constructing leptokurtic distributions is by mixing Gaussian distributions that have the same mean but different variances , similar to our doubly stochastic ( high volatility ) stimulus . When interpreting \u2018leptokurtic\u2019 noise , people appear to overreact to outliers . For instance , when making stock investment decisions , people often misinterpret large fluctuations as evidence for a fundamental change in expected value ( De Bondt and Thaler , 1990 ) . Similarly , our subjects interpreted the 'outliers' introduced by our doubly stochastic procedure ( motion bursts of unlikely strength given the average motion strength of the trial ) as if they were caused by a higher coherence stimulus . In this sense , they behaved as if the noisy samples they acquired were generated by a mesokurtic distribution ( e . g . , Gaussian ) . Is intriguing to think that the inferences and biases that people display in simple decisions about stochastic motion may bear on how they interpret and act upon stochastic signals operating over longer time scales . \n Three humans and two monkeys performed one or more tasks where they had to make binary choices about the direction of motion of a set of randomly moving dots drawn in a circular aperture . Dots could move in one of two opposite directions , and were generated as described in previous studies ( e . g . , [Roitman and Shadlen , 2002] ) . Briefly , three interleaved sets of dots were drawn in successive frames ( monitor refresh rate: 75\u00a0Hz ) . When a dot disappeared , it was redrawn 40 ms later ( i . e . , 3 video frames ) either at a random location in the stimulus aperture or displaced in the direction of motion . We refer to trials where the probability of coherent motion is fixed within the trial as \u2018low volatility\u2019 , and trials where it varies within the trial as \u2018high volatility\u2019 . Trials of low and high volatility were uncued and randomly interleaved . Example stimuli can be seen in Video 1 . We studied the relationship between volatility and decision speed with a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task ( Roitman and Shadlen , 2002 ) . Three human participants completed 6631 trials ( subject S1: 2490 trials; S2: 2070; S3: 2071 ) , and one macaque ( monkey W ) completed 14 , 137 trials . Each trial started with subjects fixating on a central spot ( 0 . 33\u00b0 diameter ) for 0 . 5\u2009s . Then two targets ( 1 . 3\u00b0 diameter ) appeared on the horizontal meridian at an eccentricity of 9\u00ba to indicate the two possible directions of motion . Observers had to maintain fixation for an additional 0 . 3\u20130 . 7\u2009s ( sampled from a truncated exponential with \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00 . 1 s ) and were then presented with the motion stimulus , centered at fixation and subtending 5\u00b0 of visual angle . Dot density was 16 . 7 dots\/deg2\/s , and the displacement of the coherent dots was consistent with apparent motion of 5 deg\/sec . Feedback was provided after each trial . Correct decisions were rewarded with a drop of juice ( monkey ) or a pleasant sounding chime ( humans ) . Errors were followed by a timeout of 1 ( human ) or 5 ( monkey ) seconds , and , in humans , also accompanied by a low-frequency tone . For the monkey , a minimum time of 950 ms was imposed from dot onset to reward delivery ( e . g . , Hanks et al . , 2011 ) in order to discourage fast guessing . Trials employing 0% coherence motion were deemed correct with probability \u00bd . A second monkey ( monkey D ) was trained to perform a direction discrimination task with post-decision wagering ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . After acquiring fixation , two targets appeared ( 6 . 5\u20139\u00b0 eccentricity ) to indicate the alternative directions of motion , followed by the motion stimulus after a variable time ( truncated exponential; range 0 . 3\u20130 . 75 s , \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00 . 25 s ) . Motion viewing duration was sampled from a truncated exponential distribution ( range\u00a00 . 1\u20130 . 93 s , \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00 . 3 s ) . After motion offset , the monkey had to maintain fixation for another 1 . 2 to 1 . 7 s . During this delay , a third target ( sure-bet target; Ts ) appeared on half of the trials , no earlier than 0 . 5 s from motion offset , positioned perpendicular to the axis of motion . After this delay , the fixation point disappeared , cueing the monkey to report its choice . Correct decisions led to a juice reward , and incorrect decisions led to a timeout ( 5 s ) . Selecting the sure-bet led to a small but certain reward , roughly equivalent to 55% of the juice volume received in correct trials . The monkey performed a total of 65 , 751 behavioral trials , a subset of which ( 44 , 334 trials ) were accompanied by neurophysiological recordings . By convention , positive motion coherences correspond to the preferred direction of motion of the recorded neurons . When paired with neural recordings , the speed and direction of motion , and the size of the circular aperture , were adjusted to match the properties of the neuron or multiunit site under study ( see below ) . The relationship between volatility and confidence was also studied in a task that required explicit confidence reports . After the subject fixated a central spot , two crescent-shaped targets appeared on each side of the fixation ( Figure 5 ) . The targets were the left and right arcs of a circle ( radius 10\u00b0 visual angle ) centered on the fixation point . These arcs were visible for for 2\u03c0\/3 radians ( i . e . , extending \u00b1 60\u00b0 angle above and below the horizontal meridian ) . The left ( right ) target ought to be selected to indicate that the perceived direction of motion was to the left ( right , respectively ) . Subjects were instructed to select the upper extreme of the targets if they were completely certain of their decision , and the lowermost extreme if they thought they were guessing . Intermediate values represent intermediate levels of confidence . Visual aid was provided by coloring the targets in green at the top , red at the bottom , with a gradual transition between the two . After a variable delay during which participants had to maintain fixation , the random dot motion stimulus was shown for a fixed duration of 200 ms . Dot speed , density and aperture size were identical to the RT experiment . After motion offset , the subjects were required to indicate their response by directing the gaze to one target . Decisions were reported without time pressure and subjects were allowed to make multiple eye movements until they pressed the spacebar to accept the confidence and the choice . The same participants that completed the RT task performed the confidence task ( subject S1: 1536 trials; S2: 2103; S3: 2107 ) . All animal procedures complied with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University . A head post and recording chamber were implanted using aseptic surgical procedures . Multi- ( MU ) and single-unit ( SU ) recordings were made with tungsten electrodes ( 1\u20132 M\u2126 , FHC ) . Areas MT ( n = 13 SU and 9 MU sites ) and MST ( n = 13 SU , 12 MU ) were identified using structural MRI scans and standard physiological criteria . We did not observe substantial differences between the two areas in the main results ( Figure 2 ) and therefore pooled the data for all analyses . However , the sample size is too small to rule out subtle differences between areas . The electrode was advanced while the monkey viewed brief , high-coherence random-dot motion stimuli of different directions while fixating a central target . When we encountered an area with robust spiking activity and clear direction-selectivity , we attempted to isolate a single neuron ( SortClient software , Plexon\u00a0Inc . , Dallas , TX , USA ) but otherwise proceeded with mapping of receptive field position , size , preferred speed and direction based on multiunit activity , as described previously ( Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) . When direction tuning was sufficiently strong ( >2\u2009S . D . separating firing rates for preferred vs . anti-preferred direction motion ) , we proceeded with the PDW task , tailoring the stimulus to the neurons\u2019 RF and tuning properties and aligning the choice targets with the axis of motion . Solid lines in Figures 3\u20135 represent fits ( or predictions ) of a bounded accumulation model . In the model , noisy momentary evidence is accumulated until the integral of the evidence ( termed the decision variable , DV ) reaches one of two bounds at \u00b1B ( t ) , or until the motion stimulus is terminated by the experimenter . The momentary evidence comprises samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean \u03bac and variance \u03c3v2 ( c ) , where \u03ba is a constant , c is the motion coherence , and v indicates whether the volatility is high or low . In most applications of diffusion models , the variance is assumed to be fixed and independent of motion strength , but our analyses of the motion energy and the neuronal recordings ( Figure 2 ) , motivate a more complex dependence of variance on c and v . To capture these trends parsimoniously , we modeled the variance as a linear function of motion strength ( 2 ) \u03c3low2 ( c ) =1+\u03b2|c| plus an offset for the high volatility , which was maximal at c\u00a0=\u00a00 and diminishing at higher coherences: ( 3 ) \u03c3high2 ( c ) =\u03c3low2 ( c ) +\u03b1e\u2212\u03b3|c| The three degrees of freedom ( \u03b2 , \u03b1 , \u03b3 ) control the slope of the coherence dependence , the effect of volatility at c=0 , and its diminishing effect at higher coherence ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We constrained the variance in the high volatility condition to be monotonically increasing . Note that the unity constant in Equation 2 is necessary because a model in which the offset is a free parameter in addition to \u03ba and B ( t ) is equivalent to one in which the offset is set to 1 and \u03ba and B ( t ) are scaled appropriately ( Palmer et al . , 2005; Shadlen et al . , 2006 ) . For a given motion coherence and volatility ( v ) , the probability density function for the state of the decision variable ( x ) as a function of time ( t ) is given by a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation: ( 4 ) \u2202p ( x , t ) \u2202t=\u2212\u03bac\u2202p ( x , t ) \u2202x+0 . 5\u03c3v2 ( c ) \u22022p ( x , t ) \u22022x where p is the probability density of decision variable x at time t . Boundary conditions were such that the probability mass is 1 for x=0 at t=0 , and the probability density vanishes at the upper and lower bounds \u00b1B ( t ) . Confidence is given by the probability of being correct given the state of the evidence ( x ) and elapsed time , which could either correspond to the time of bound-crossing or the stimulus duration if no bound was reached . Because the direction decision depends on the sign of x , the sign of the decision variable must equal the sign of the coherence for the choice to be correct , except for 0% coherence trials that are rewarded at random . Therefore , ( 5 ) p ( corr|x , t ) =\u2211vp ( corr\u2223x , t , v ) p ( v|x , t ) p ( corr|x , t , v ) =\u2211c|sign ( c ) =sign ( x ) p ( c|x , t , v ) +12p ( c=0|x , t , v ) where t is either the time at which the bound was hit or the time at which the stimulus was curtailed . The distribution over coherences p ( c|x , t , v ) can be obtained by Bayes rule , such that p ( c|x , t , v ) \u221d\u00a0p ( x , t|c , v ) p ( c|v ) , where the constant of proportionality ensures that \u2211cp ( c|x , t , v ) =1 . This constitutes a mapping between the DV and probability correct , which is the basis for assignment of confidence to a decision ( Figure 1C ) . In general we assume that the same mapping p ( corr|x , t ) supports confidence ratings ( and PDW ) on all trials irrespective of volatility , but evaluate this assumption using the alternative models described below . The data were fit to maximize the likelihood of the parameters given the choice , confidence and RTs observed on each trial . In the RT task , the model parameters were maximum likelihood fits to choice and RT: ( 6 ) \u03be^RT=arg max\u03beRT ( \u2211i=1Nlog ( p ( choicei , RTi|ci , vi , \u03beRT ) ) ) where \u03beRT represents the model parameters for the RT task , i is the trial number and N is the total number of trials . The probability density function for the time of bound crossing ( decision times ) is obtained by numerical solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation . The difference between the reaction time and the decision time is the non-decision latency , assumed to reflect sensory and motor delays unrelated to motion strength or volatility . This latency is assumed Gaussian with mean \u03bctnd and standard deviation \u03c3tnd . The RT probability density function is obtained by convolving the p . d . f . of the decision times with the distribution of non-decision latencies . For the PDW task , the log likelihood is a sum of two terms , ( 7 ) \u03be^PDW=arg max\u03bePDW ( LS++LS\u2212 ) where LS+ ( LS\u2212 ) is the log-likelihood computed over trials with ( without ) the sure-bet target , and \u03bePDW are the model parameters . For trials without the sure target , the log-likelihood of the parameters is ( 8 ) LS\u2212=\u2211i=1Nlog\u2061 ( p ( choicei|ci , vi , Ti , \u03bePDW ) ) where the summation runs over trials without the sure target , and Ti is the duration of the stimulus on trial i . The argument of the summations is computed as follows . If pup ( t ) is the probability of crossing the upper bound at time t , then the probability of crossing the bound anytime before time T is ( 9 ) Pup ( T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) =\u222b0Tdt\u00a0pup ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) and ( 10 ) p ( choice=1|c , v , T , \u03bePDW ) =Pup ( T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) +p ( x>0 , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) where choice '1' is associated with a positive DV ( i . e . , x>0 ) . In the equation , p ( x>0 , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) is the probability that the decision variable ( x ) is positive at time T and that no bound has been reached before T . For trials where the sure-bet target was offered , we compute the likelihood of the parameters given the three possible responses in a trial: the two directional choices and the sure bet choice . We assumed that subjects opt out of reporting the direction choice and select the sure bet if the confidence in the decision is lower than a criterion , \u03a6 , which was the same for conditions of low and high volatility . The value identifies a probability contour like those depicted in Figure 1C . It demarcates a zone in the middle of the graph depicted in Figure 1C in which the state of the evidence would lead the subject to opt out . Therefore , the probability of opting out of the direction choice p ( o ) is ( 11 ) p ( o|c , v , T , \u03bePDW ) =\u222b\u2212B ( t ) +B ( t ) dx\u00a0p ( x , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( \u03a6\u2212p ( corr|x , T ) ) +\u222b0Tdt\u00a0pup ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( \u03a6\u2212p ( corr|Bup ( t ) , t ) ) +\u00a0\u222b0Tdt\u00a0plo ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( \u03a6\u2212p ( corr|Blo ( t ) , t ) ) where \u210b ( x ) is a step function that evaluates to one if x>0 , and zero otherwise . The first term on the right-hand side of the equation integrates the probability density that has not been absorbed at a bound before time T and for which probability correct is lower than \u03a6 . The second and third terms allow for the possibility that even when a bound was reached , the probability correct at the bound is lower than the criterion \u03a6 . In practice , this only occurs ( e . g . , during fitting ) when the bound is too low or the criterion is too high . Bup ( t ) and Blo ( t ) correspond to the height of the upper and lower bounds at time t , respectively . For readability , we have omitted the dependence of p ( corr ) on some parameters ( e . g . , \u03bePDW ) . The probability of waiving the sure bet and making a direction choice follows the complementary logic: ( 12 ) p ( choice=1|c , v , T , \u03bePDW ) =\u222b0Tdt\u00a0pup ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( p ( corr|+B ( t ) , t ) \u2212\u03a6 ) +\u222b0+B ( t ) dx\u00a0p ( x , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( p ( corr|x , T ) \u2212\u03a6 ) where the first term of the right-hand side corresponds to the probability of selecting choice '1' when the bound is reached , and the second term computes the probability of selecting this choice when no bound is reached before T . In the human confidence task , we performed a maximum likelihood fit to the choice reported on each trial: ( 13 ) \u03be^HCONF=argmax\u03beHCONF ( \u2211i=1Nlog\u2061 ( p ( choicei|ci , vi , Ti , \u03beHCONF ) ) ) where \u03be^HCONF is the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters and the likelihood is computed as described by Equation 10 . We fit only one parameter per subject ( \u03ba ) . The rest of the parameters were taken from the RT task ( i . e . , from \u03be^RT; see Table 1 ) . Note that confidence was not used for the fits , and therefore the solid curves in Figure 5 can be considered predictions of the model . For the RT task , we allowed the bound height to change as a function of time , as suggested by previous work ( Churchland et al . , 2008; Hanks et al . , 2011; Drugowitsch et al . , 2012 ) . The upper and lower bounds were symmetric around zero , and were parameterized by a logistic function of time: ( 14 ) B ( t|a , d ) =\u00a0\u00b1B0 ( 1+expa ( t\u2212d ) ) \u22121 where a and d are the scale and location parameters of the logistic . The bound parameters were constrained to be the same for the two volatility conditions , except in the alternative model for the RT task where we fit separate B0 for the two volatility conditions ( Table 2 ) . In the human confidence task , the presence of bounds did not improve the quality of the fits . This implies that subjects used all the stimulus information to inform their choices , presumably because the stimulus duration was only 0 . 2\u2009s . In the PDW , a stationary bound ( i . e . , B ( t ) =\u00a0B0 ) improved the quality of the fits . In the human confidence experiment , we do not know how each subject maps a position on the rating scale ( position along the crescent target ) to probability correct . Therefore , we assumed a monotonic transformation between the expected probability correct p ( corr|c , v ) and saccadic end point . Probability correct p ( corr|c , v ) was obtained by marginalizing p ( corr|x , t ) over the state of the evidence ( x ) at the time of decision termination ( t ) . Because we did not include a bound in the human confidence task , t is the stimulus duration ( i . e . , T\u00a0=\u00a00 . 2 s ) . The distribution of the DV at decision time depends on coherence c\u00a0and volatility v , therefore ( 15 ) p ( corr|c , v ) =\u222b\u200bdx p ( corr|x , T ) p ( x , t=T|c , v ) The monotonic transformation \u2131 that maps probability correct to the average position in the rating scale \u27e8sac ( c , v ) \u27e9tr was constructed as a linear combination of three error functions plus a constant offset: \u2131 ( x ) =\u2211i=13wi\u00a0erfi ( x\u2212ois ) +k , where oi is an offset term , and s is a scaling parameter . The three linear weights and the offset k were fit to minimize the sum of squared differences between \u2131[p ( corr|c , v ) ] and \u27e8sac ( c , v ) \u27e9tr . Similar results were obtained using different parameterizations of \u2131 . For the PDW task , we explored three alternative 'two map' models . In the first , we used a different mapping between DV and confidence for each volatility condition . Each map is the one that should be used if the volatility condition of each trial were known ( i . e . , the one specified by the bottom row of Equation 5 ) . For the second two-map model , the assessment of volatility develops gradually during the trial . We assume that for a trial i with stimulus duration Ti , the probability that the decision maker can identify the trial\u2019s volatility is given by w ( Ti ) =1\u2212e\u2212Ti\/\u03c4 . For trials where the sure bet was offered , we compute the probability of the action that was chosen by the monkey as a weighted average of the two probabilities: the probability that results from using a common map for both volatility conditions , which was weighted by ( 1\u2212w ( Ti ) ) , and the probability obtained from using the mapping that corresponds to the appropriate volatility of the trial , which was weighted by w ( Ti ) . The time constant \u03c4 was fitted to data . If \u03c4 is small , information about volatility builds up rapidly and the decision maker can use the appropriate map for each condition . Fitting the model to data showed that the volatility information develops very gradually , with w ( t ) being ~0 . 01 for a 1-s stimulus . For the third model , besides using different mappings between DV and confidence for the two volatility conditions , we also fit independent bounds , such that B0high\u00a0=\u00a0B0\u00a0+\u0394B0 where B denotes bound height ( see Table 2 ) . Best fitting parameters for the three alternative models and the BIC comparisons to the model of Figure 4 are shown in Table 2 . To examine whether high volatility leads to faster responses in the reaction time task , we fit a linear regression model for each subject where the reaction time is given by ( 16 ) RT=\u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv where Iv is an indicator variable for volatility ( 1: high , 0: low ) , and \u03b2\u2019s are fitted coefficients . Unless otherwise indicated , the null hypothesis is that the \u03b2 term associated with Iv equals zero , evaluated with t-test ( t-statistics were derived using the parameter estimates and their associated standard errors [i . e . , the square root of the elements in the diagonal of the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates] ) . To evaluate the influence of volatility on accuracy , we used logistic regression , excluding trials of 0% coherence: ( 17 ) pcorrect=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv ) ]\u22121 The influence of volatility was evaluated with a likelihood-ratio test comparing models with and without the \u03b22 term . We also used logistic regression to evaluate the effect of volatility on accuracy when pooling data across subjects and experiments: ( 18 ) pcorrect=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20 , s , xIs , x+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22 , s , xIs , xIv ) ]\u22121 where Is , x are indicator variables for every combination of task and subject ( n\u00a0=\u00a08 ) . This equation parallels the structure of the previous one . The first term in the argument of the exponential allows fitting a different intercept for each combination of task and subject , and the third term allows for different intercepts on high and low volatility trials . The significance of the influence of volatility on accuracy was evaluated with a likelihood ratio test comparing nested models with and without the \u03b22 terms , with the test statistic evaluated against a \u03c72\u00a0distribution with n\u00a0=\u00a08 degrees of freedom . Only non-zero coherences were included in this analysis . Similarly , to evaluate the influence of volatility on the monkey\u2019s PDW behavior on trials where the sure bet was offered , we fit ( 19 ) pwaived=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv+\u03b23Td ) ]\u22121 where pwaived is the probability that the sure bet was declined , and Td is stimulus duration . We also examined whether availability of the sure bet influenced accuracy: ( 20 ) pcorrect=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv+\u03b23Td+\u03b24Is|c| ) ]\u22121 where Is is 1 if the sure bet was offered , and 0 otherwise . A positive \u03b24 indicates that the accuracy increases if the sure bet is offered but waived . In the human confidence task , we mapped subjects\u2019 confidence reports to a 0\u20131 scale , such that \u20180\u2019 stands for \u2018guessing\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for \u2018full certainty\u2019 . To evaluate the significance of the effect of volatility on confidence we fit for each subject the following linear regression model: ( 21 ) conf=\u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv While the motion coherence specifies the nominal strength of motion in the stimulus , the effective motion strength varies from trial to trial and even within trials , due to the random fluctuations in the stimulus . To extract the effective motion strength , we computed the motion energy in the stimulus ( Adelson and Bergen , 1985; Kiani et al . , 2008 ) , following published procedures which we briefly review here . We convolved the sequence of random dots presented on each trial with two pairs of spatiotemporal filters . Each pair of filters is selective for one of the two alternative directions of motion ( \u00b1x ) . Directional selectivity is achieved through the addition or subtraction of two space-time separable filters . As in previous work ( Kiani et al . , 2008 ) , the temporal impulse responses are: ( 22 ) fast ( t ) = ( 60t ) 3exp\u2061 ( \u221260t ) [13 ! \u2212 ( 60t ) 2 ( 3+2 ) ! ]slow ( t ) = ( 60t ) 5exp\u2061 ( \u221260t ) [15 ! \u2212 ( 60t ) 2 ( 5+2 ) ! ] The spatial filters are even ( mirror-symmetric ) and odd ( non-symmetric ) fourth order Cauchy functions: ( 23 ) even ( x , y ) =cos4\u2061 ( \u03b1 ) cos ( 4\u03b1 ) exp\u2061 ( \u2212y22\u03c3g2 ) odd ( x , y ) =cos4\u2061 ( \u03b1 ) sin ( 4\u03b1 ) exp\u2061 ( \u2212y22\u03c3g2 ) where \u03b1=tan\u22121 ( x\/\u03c3c ) . The constants in Equations 22 and 23 were adjusted to match the apparent speed of the coherently moving dots . The two pairs of directionally selective filters were obtained through appropriate addition and subtraction of the product of a spatial and a temporal filter . Specifically , the two filters selective to the +x direction are given by \u2018slow \u00d7 even \u2013 fast \u00d7 odd\u2019 , and \u2018slow \u00d7 odd + fast \u00d7 even\u2019 . Filters selective to the -x direction are given by \u2018fast \u00d7 odd + slow \u00d7 even\u2019 , and \u2018fast \u00d7 even \u2013 slow \u00d7 odd\u2019 . The four directional filters were convolved with the 3-dimensional ( x , y , time ) stimulus . After squaring the output and adding the two filters that prefer the same direction , we compute opponent motion energy by subtracting -x from +x preferring responses . Finally , we average across space to obtain a temporal signal , etr ( t ) , which quantifies how motion strength varies within each trial . Because the motion energy has arbitrary units , which varies , for instance , with the size of the stimulus , we normalized etr ( t ) multiplying it by a constant \u03bb . The normalization constant was the same for all trials in a session , and was set such that the motion energy is , on average , equal to the motion coherence . This normalization is possible because the motion energy is a linear function of the motion coherence . The motion energy profile for etr ( t ) is shown in Figure 2A for an example trial . To characterize the mean and variance of the motion energy for high and low volatility ( Figure 2B ) , we first computed the average motion energy for each trial , i . e . etr=\u27e8etr ( t ) \u27e9t , ignoring the rise and decay times of the motion filters , that is from 50 ms after motion onset to 50 ms after offset . The mean and variance of etr was computed over subsets of trials grouped by motion coherence and volatility condition . We used logistic regression to determine if the motion energy profile of each trial of the PDW task contains enough information to identify the trial\u2019s volatility . We calculated the mean ( etr ) and an index of the dispersion ( etrv ) of the motion energy time course for each trial . The dispersion index was estimated as the variance of the distribution of motion energy values estimated at the frame rate , ignoring the autocorrelation in motion energy profile . Thus , etrv is more accurately described as a measure of dispersion of the motion energy profile on single trials rather than as an estimate of the variance . The mean and the dispersion of the motion energy were used together with the stimulus duration ( Td ) to train a logistic regression model to classify the volatility condition of each trial: ( 24 ) pvtr=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|etr|+\u03b22etrv+\u03b23Td+\u03b24|etr|etrv ) ]\u22121 where pvtr is the probability that trial tr is of high volatility . After fitting the logistic model , we estimated the degree of overlap in the distributions of pvtr between trials of low and high volatility . The area under the ROC curve was 0 . 895 , indicating that there is information in the stimulus to reliably estimate the volatility condition of each trial , even for the brief stimulus presentations used in the PDW task . If we remove the interaction term ( \u03b24 ) the area under the ROC curve is 0 . 85 . To be clear , we do not put forward this calculation as a plausible model for inferring volatility . It merely serves to document that information is present in the stimuli to render a categorization possible . For simplicity , in what follows we refer to both single units and multiunit sites as \u2018neurons\u2019 . To investigate how the volatility manipulation affected the mean and variance of the neuronal response , we first counted spikes occurring between 100\u00a0ms and 200\u00a0ms from stimulus onset . To avoid artifacts produced by the response to the offset of the RDM stimulus , we restricted this analysis to trials where the motion stimulus was presented for at least 150 ms . The counts were standardized ( z-scored ) independently for each neuron and subsequently grouped across neurons to obtain a large array of normalized counts , str , where tr indexes the trial number across sessions . Figure 2C shows the mean ( \u03bcc , v ) and the variance ( \u03c3c , v2 ) of str computed over the subset of trials given by every combination of motion coherence and volatility condition . These analyses furnished empirical estimates of the mean and variance of the spike count as a function of motion strength and direction . Findings from neurophysiology ( Ditterich et al . , 2003 ) and computational modeling ( Mazurek et al . , 2003 ) suggest that the momentary evidence is proportional to the difference of firing rates between pools of neurons with opposite direction preferences ( e . g . , right-preferring minus left-preferring ) . The expectation of this difference variable ( \u0394 ) can be estimated empirically: ( 25 ) \u03bc\u0394|c , v\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bcc , v\u2212\u03bc\u2212c , v where c and -c indicate motion in the preferred and anti-preferred direction of the neuron , for motion strength c . The mean of the difference variable is shown in Figure 2D , with mean counts \u03bcc , v and \u03bc\u2212c , v obtained from Figure 2C . The variance of the difference variable ( \u03c3\u03942 ) was approximated as follows . Because the variance of a sum equals the sum of the covariances , if the average pairwise correlation for a pool of n neurons is given by r , then the variance of the average response of the pool is ( \u03c32n+n\u22121nr\u03c32 ) , where \u03c32 is the variance in the spike counts from a single neuron . As n becomes large ( in practice , above 50 to 100 neurons is sufficient ) , the variance of the pool converges to r\u03c32 . Further , there is a portion of the variance that is shared between neurons tuned to the preferred and anti-preferred directions . If the correlation between the average responses of populations of neurons with opposite directional preferences is given by \u03c1 , the variance of the difference variable as is given by Equation 1 of the main text . For the analyses depicted in Figure 7 , we extracted the spike times from each trial up to 50 ms after motion offset and then smoothed the spike counts with a centered boxcar filter with a 30 ms width . For the analysis of Figure 7B we computed , for each neuron , the difference in firing rate between the response to the preferred and the non-preferred directions , for trials of the highest coherence ( c\u00a0=\u00a00 . 512 ) . This difference was used to estimate the latency with which motion information is represented in these neurons , regardless of the choice . For the analyses of Figure 7A , C , D , we obtained the residuals of firing rate by subtracting , from each trial and time step , the average firing rate of the same neuron on trials having the same motion direction , coherence and volatility . To group trials across neurons , we divided the activity of each neuron by a normalization constant , given by the maximum average firing rate at the highest coherence ( i . e . , c = 0 . 512 ) . The latencies in Figure 7B were estimated with a curve fitting procedure based on the CUSUM method ( Ellaway , 1978 ) . In the CUSUM method , the latency of the difference between two conditions is estimated based the cumulative sum of the differences , thereby achieving robustness against the noisiness of individual data point . The cumulative sum of differences was fit to a curve composed of two lines , the first of which was constrained to have a zero slope [similar to Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) ; Van den Berg et al . ( 2016 ) ] . The latency is then estimated as the time point when the two lines intersect . Standard errors of the latency estimates were derived with a bootstrapping procedure ( N\u00a0=\u00a01000 ) .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods"],"keywords":["neuroscience"],"id":"elife-17688-v1"}
{"lay_summary":"Oculo-Cerebro-Renal syndrome of Lowe ( Lowe syndrome ) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause cataracts , mental disabilities and kidney dysfunction . It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding OCRL , a protein that modifies a membrane lipid and that is found on membranes transporting molecules ( cargo ) into cells by a process known as endocytosis . During endocytosis , the cell outer membrane is deformed into a pit that engulfs the cargo to be taken up by the cell . The pit then pinches off from the outer membrane to form a vesicle\u2014a bubble-like compartment\u2014inside the cell that transports the cargo to its destination . In one type of endocytosis , this process is mediated by a basket-like coat primarily made up from the protein clathrin that assembles at the membrane patch to be internalized . After the vesicle is released from the cell membrane , the clathrin coat is broken apart and its components are shed and recycled for use by new budding endocytic vesicles . The OCRL protein had previously been observed associated to newly forming clathrin-coated vesicles , but the significance of this was not known . Now , N\u00e1ndez et al . have used a range of imaging and analytical techniques to further investigate the properties of OCRL , taking advantage of cells from patients with Lowe syndrome . These cells lack OCRL , and so allow the effect of OCRL's absence on cell function to be deduced . OCRL destroys the membrane lipid that helps to connect the clathrin coat to the membrane , and N\u00e1ndez et al . show that without OCRL the newly formed vesicle moves into the cell but fails to efficiently shed its clathrin coat . Thus , a large fraction of clathrin coat components remain trapped on the vesicles , reducing the amount of such components available to help new pits develop into vesicles . As a consequence , the cell has difficulty internalizing molecules . Collectively , the findings of N\u00e1ndez et al . outline that OCRL plays a role in the regulation of endocytosis in addition to its previously reported actions in the control of intracellular membrane traffic . The results also help to explain some of the symptoms seen in Lowe syndrome patients .","article":"Mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease . Although OCRL , a direct clathrin interactor , is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits , clinical manifestations have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects . Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect . These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits , which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles . Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells . SNX9 , an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly , remains associated with such vesicles . These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations . \n Reversible phosphorylation of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol at the 3 , 4 and 5 position generates seven phosphoinositide species , which play critical regulatory roles in cell physiology via their property to control interactions at the cytosolic surface of membranes . Phosphoinositide levels are dynamically and spatially regulated by kinases and phosphatases , establishing a code of membrane identity ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006; Vicinanza et al . , 2008; Balla , 2013 ) . The human genome contains 10 genes encoding inositol 5-phosphatases , a group of enzymes that dephosphorylate the inositol ring at the 5 position , nine of which act on inositol phospholipids ( Dyson et al . , 2012; Pirruccello and De Camilli , 2012 ) . Mutations in one such gene , OCRL , give rise to Oculo-Cerebro-Renal syndrome of Lowe ( Lowe syndrome ) and type 2 Dent's disease , two X-linked diseases ( Attree et al . , 1992; Hoopes et al . , 2005 ) . Lowe syndrome is characterized by congenital cataracts , renal proximal tubule dysfunction , cognitive disabilities and developmental delay ( Delleman et al . , 1977; Kenworthy and Charnas , 1995; B\u00f6ckenhauer et al . , 2008 ) . Patients with Dent's disease exhibit similar proximal tubule defects but no , or only mild , additional clinical defects ( B\u00f6kenkamp et al . , 2009; Shrimpton et al . , 2009 ) . OCRL has a modular structure that is comprised of an N-terminal PH domain ( Mao et al . , 2009 ) followed in sequence by an unstructured amino acid stretch , the 5-phosphatase domain , an ASPM-SPD2-Hydin ( ASH ) domain and a catalytically-inactive RhoGAP-like domain ( Ponting , 2006; Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . OCRL is expressed in all tissues and has a broad subcellular distribution , which is mediated by interactions with proteins that control membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton . These include clathrin-heavy chain , the clathrin adaptor AP-2 , Rab and Rho family GTPases and the endosomal adaptors APPL1 and Ses1\/2 ( Ungewickell et al . , 2004; Choudhury et al . , 2005 , 2009; Shin et al . , 2005; Hyvola et al . , 2006; Lichter-Konecki et al . , 2006; Erdmann et al . , 2007; Fukuda et al . , 2008; Swan et al . , 2010; Dambournet et al . , 2011; Noakes et al . , 2011; Pirruccello et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with such interactions , OCRL has been localized to the Golgi complex , to a variety of endosomal compartments as well as to clathrin-coated pits ( Olivos-Glander et al . , 1995; Dressman et al . , 2000; Ungewickell et al . , 2004; Choudhury et al . , 2005; Faucherre et al . , 2005; Hyvola et al . , 2006; Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . INPP5B , a 5-phosphatase very similar to OCRL , has many of the same properties , but does not bind clathrin and AP-2 , and correspondingly is not localized at endocytic clathrin-coated pits ( Erdmann et al . , 2007; Williams et al . , 2007 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , the two preferred substrates of OCRL , are primarily concentrated in the plasma membrane , where they help define its identity . The broad intracellular localization of OCRL may reflect its importance in preventing the build-up of ectopic intracellular pools of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 . Alternatively , OCRL may act on small yet physiologically relevant pools of these phosphoinositides on intracellular membranes . The pathological manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease are thought to arise from abnormal protein sorting and membrane recycling ( Erdmann et al . , 2007; Swan et al . , 2010; Vicinanza et al . , 2011; Mehta et al . , 2014 ) , as loss of OCRL would disrupt the appropriate coordination between membrane progression and changes in phosphoinositide composition . One open question is the physiological significance of the localization of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits . Nucleation and expansion of endocytic clathrin coats requires PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 represents a critical co-receptor for all the clathrin adaptors ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006; Mettlen et al . , 2009; Sun et al . , 2007; Traub , 2009 ) and its levels ( controlled by dynamic turnover ) impact the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits ( Zoncu et al . , 2007; Nakatsu et al . , 2010; Antonescu et al . , 2011 ) . Conversely , coat shedding ( uncoating ) after the endocytic reaction requires PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dephosphorylation , as first revealed by studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in axon terminals ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . Absence of synaptojanin 1 , the most abundant 5-phosphatase in the synapse , results in a striking accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles ( Cremona et al . , 1999; Harris et al . , 2000; Verstreken et al . , 2003; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . There is also evidence that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dephosphorylation may assist in the fission reaction of endocytosis ( Stefan et al . , 2002; Rusk et al . , 2003; Mani et al . , 2007; Sun et al . , 2007; Liu et al . , 2009; Chang-Ileto et al . , 2011 ) . While it has been shown that OCRL has a role in preventing the accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on post-endocytic membranes ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) , there is no evidence to date that the absence of OCRL , or defects in OCRL function , impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis . The initial goal of this study was to gain new insights into the function of OCRL through a global analysis of the OCRL interactome . Such an analysis corroborated evidence for a primary role of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits as it confirmed clathrin and other endocytic adaptors as OCRL binding partners . In addition , it revealed that SNX9 , a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits , directly binds OCRL . Prompted by these findings , we examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts . We found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect . These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat . Such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells ( Suchy and Nussbaum , 2002; Allen , 2003; Hayes et al . , 2009; Cui et al . , 2010; Dambournet et al . , 2011; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Our findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors , a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis . Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease . \n The binding partners of an enzyme define its sites of action and regulatory mechanisms . Towards an improved understanding of the function of OCRL , we carried out a global analysis of its protein interactome . OCRL immunoprecipitates were analyzed through quantitative label-free interaction proteomics by mass spectrometry . This technique , in contrast to other methods such as yeast two-hybrids or pull-downs with purified proteins , allows the preferential capture of physiologically occurring protein complexes ( Vermeulen et al . , 2008 ) . To this aim , HeLa M cell lines stably expressing either GFP-OCRL or GFP alone were generated ( Figure 1A\u2013C ) so that OCRL specific interactions could be identified by analysis of proteins selectively recovered in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from cells expressing GFP-OCRL . While GFP alone had a diffuse cytosolic distribution , GFP-OCRL had a punctate localization characteristic of endogeneous OCRL immunoreactivity ( Figure 1A\u2013C ) , thus validating GFP-OCRL expressing cells as an appropriate model for our experiments . Two cell lines were used for further analysis , which expressed GFP-OCRL at near endogenous levels ( 1X ) or at about five times the endogenous level ( 5X ) , as revealed by western blotting against OCRL ( Figure 1D ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 003Figure 1 .

A hyperbolic curve ( red dotted line ) separates specific OCRL-interacting proteins from background .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 004 Inspection of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates generated from these cells by SDS-PAGE gels prior to mass spectrometry revealed a very robust specific enrichment of GFP-OCRL in samples from GFP-OCRL expressing cells ( Figure 1E ) . As expected , a major band was detected at 170 KD ( Figure 1E ) , shown to be clathrin heavy chain by western blotting ( Figure 1F; Ungewickell et al . , 2004; Choudhury et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , there were numerous other bands selectively observed in GFP-OCRL samples . Mass spectrometry further confirmed clathrin heavy and light chain as major hits in the immunoprecipitates and revealed additional specific OCRL interactors ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1; Supplementary file 1A , B ) . These included known binding partners of OCRL , such as subunits of the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP-2 , Rab proteins and Ses1\/2 but , surprisingly , not APPL1 . Possibly APPL1 was outcompeted by Ses1\/2 , which bind to the same site in OCRL but with a higher affinity ( Swan et al . , 2010; Noakes et al . , 2011; Pirruccello et al . , 2011 ) . Specific interactors also included numerous proteins implicated in membrane trafficking , primarily along the endocytic pathway and vesicular transport steps between endosomes and the Golgi complex ( Supplementary file 1A , B ) . Proteins that participate in clathrin-dependent transport steps featured particularly prominently in the OCRL interactome . The enrichment of these proteins in the GFP-OCRL immunoprecipitate relative to the homogenate was further assessed by western blot analysis . In addition to clathrin , interactors such as AP-2 , EpsinR ( CLINT1 ) , SNX9 and PI3KcII\u03b1 showed the highest enrichment by western blotting ( Figure 1G ) . The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor ( CI-M6PR ) , a cargo protein for clathrin-coated pits whose transport was previously shown to be affected by OCRL knockdown ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) , was also confirmed by western blotting , but was not as enriched ( Figure 1G ) . Clathrin and AP-2 are known to bind OCRL directly , while EpsinR , SNX9 and PI3KcII\u03b1 are all known clathrin interactors ( Gaidarov et al . , 2001; Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003; Mills et al . , 2003 ) . These findings raised the possibility that at least some of these proteins may bind OCRL indirectly through clathrin . In fact , a substantial overlap was observed between major OCRL interactors revealed by our experiments and proteins previously identified in a similar mass spectrometry analysis of clathrin binding partners ( Hubner et al . , 2010 ) as well as in a global analysis of clathrin-coated vesicles ( Blondeau et al . , 2004; Borner et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , to determine the contribution of clathrin to the interactions of OCRL , anti-GFP immunoprecipitations were repeated with cells expressing a GFP-OCRL construct lacking clathrin-binding sites . Anti-GFP immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts from cells expressing either GFP-OCRLWT ( wild type OCRL ) or GFP-OCRLX3 ( an OCRL mutant in which both clathrin boxes as well as the AP-2-binding motif are mutated [Mao et al . , 2009] ) ( Figure 1H ) . Western blot analysis revealed that loss of clathrin and AP-2 binding was accompanied by the loss of CI-M6PR , EpsinR and PI3KcII\u03b1 in the anti-GFP-OCRLX3 immunoprecipitates ( Figure 1I ) . In contrast , the interaction of OCRL with SNX9 , which also contains binding sites for clathrin and for AP-2 ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003 ) , was not abolished by the three mutations in OCRL ( Figure 1I ) . This prompted us to explore the possibility of a direct interaction between OCRL and SNX9 . SNX9 binds other proteins implicated in the late stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis , such as dynamin , synaptojanin and N-WASP , through an N-terminal SH3 domain that recognizes proline-rich motifs with the canonical PxxP sequence ( Figure 2A; Badour et al . , 2007; Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003; Mayer , 2001; Yeow-Fong et al . , 2005 ) . OCRL contains a PxxP site ( 175REPPPPP181 ) in the predicted unfolded region that connects its N-terminal PH domain to its central inositol 5-phosphatase domain ( Figure 2A ) . Anti-GFP immunoprecipitation of cell extracts expressing GFP-OCRLWT co-enriched endogenous SNX9 , while a GFP-OCRL mutant in which three prolines ( P177 , 178 , and 181 ) of the PxxP motif were mutated to alanine ( GFP-OCRLP3 ) , failed to co-precipitate SNX9 ( Figure 2B ) . Conversely , GFP-SNX9WT but not a GFP-SNX9 construct lacking the SH3 domain ( GFP-SNX9\u0394SH3 ) co-precipitated endogenous OCRL ( Figure 2C ) . Therefore , we concluded that the PxxP motif in OCRL is necessary for the interaction with SNX9 . A close paralogue of SNX9 with partially overlapping functions is SNX18 ( Park et al . , 2010 ) . Anti-GFP immunoprecipitations from cells expressing a GFP fusion of SNX18 also recovered endogenous OCRL ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 005Figure 2 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 006 To determine whether the PxxP motif of OCRL was sufficient to bind SNX9 , GST fusions of N-terminal fragments of OCRL comprising the PH domain and portions of its flanking unfolded region , including ( GST-OCRL217 ) or excluding ( GST-OCRL176 ) the PxxP motif , were tested in pull-down experiments from mouse brain lysates ( Figure 2D ) . Both fragments contained a previously described clathrin box ( 73LIDIA77 ) ( Mao et al . , 2009 ) and each recovered clathrin , as expected ( Figure 2D ) . However , only the OCRL217 fragment containing the PxxP motif pulled down SNX9 ( Figure 2D ) . Collectively , these results indicate that SNX9 directly binds OCRL via an interaction of its SH3 domain with the PxxP site in OCRL . A direct binding of SNX9 to OCRL is consistent with the localization of both proteins at late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits , as shown by the analysis of these two proteins expressed independently ( Soulet et al . , 2005; Erdmann et al . , 2007; Yarar et al . , 2007; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Based on a systematic analysis of the peak of endocytic protein recruitment at pits relative to the closure of their neck , Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) further reported that OCRL peaks slightly after SNX9 . To directly compare the spatiotemporal relationship between two proteins at clathrin-coated pits , time-lapse confocal microscopy was performed on human wild type fibroblasts co-expressing GFP-SNX9 and mCherry-OCRL . Inspection of these cells revealed rapidly turning over puncta of both OCRL and SNX9 uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane , as expected for late stage clathrin-coated pits ( Figure 2E ) . In the great majority of cases ( 93 . 18 \u00b1 1 . 25%; n = 150 events , 3 independent experiments ) , the peak of OCRL fluorescence lagged slightly behind that of SNX9 , suggesting a very late function of OCRL in clathrin-mediated budding ( Figure 2E\u2013G; Video 1 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 007Video 1 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 007 These findings support a role of OCRL in the very late stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis . However , evidence from loss-of-function studies confirming this role is still missing . To investigate this possibility , we examined endocytic clathrin-coated pits and their dynamics in patient cells that lack OCRL . Dermal fibroblasts derived from a Lowe syndrome patient and from a control subject were used for these studies . Patient cells lack OCRL , as indeed confirmed by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3A , B ) and western blotting ( Figure 3C ) . Accordingly , a near 1 . 5-fold increase in the steady state levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was also observed in these cells as expected ( Figure 3D; Zhang et al . , 1998; Wenk et al . , 2003 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 008Figure 3 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 008 Immunofluorescence for endogenous clathrin and AP-2 showed a robust increase of their punctate immunoreactivity in patient cells ( Figure 3E\u2013H ) . An even more striking increase was observed for SNX9 puncta ( Figure 3I\u2013J ) ( see also below ) . Additionally , clathrin-coated pits showed a clustered distribution . Exogenous overexpression of GFP-OCRLWT rescued this phenotype ( Figure 3K\u2013K\u2032 ) , while expression of a catalytically inactive OCRL ( GFP-OCRLD523G ) failed to do so ( Figure 3L\u2013L\u2032 ) . Such phenotypes were reminiscent of the accumulation of puncta positive for endocytic clathrin coat components observed in cells where the progression of late stage clathrin-coated pits to free vesicles is impaired ( Ferguson et al . , 2009; Posor et al . , 2013 ) , strongly suggesting that lack of OCRL affects the completion of the endocytic reaction . Thus far , defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis have not been reported in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts , and therefore we next analyzed clathrin-coated pit dynamics in patient and control cells by time-lapse microscopy . The dynamics of endocytic clathrin-coated pits in human fibroblasts were assessed by monitoring the fluorescence of GFP-tagged \u00b52 subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 ( \u00b52-GFP ) by live Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , followed by an automated analysis of \u00b52 puncta to determine their global lifetime distributions ( Liang et al . , 2014 ) . Using expectation-maximization algorithms , a Gaussian mixture model was then fitted to each population of puncta , grouping events into three distinct cohorts: short , medium and long with mean lifetimes of 40 s ( short ) , 108 s ( medium ) and 244 s ( long ) , respectively . As expected , \u00b52 puncta exhibited dynamic turnover in control cells , with only a small fraction of long-lived pits ( short: 36 . 8% , medium: 46 . 6% , long: 16 . 6% ) ( Figure 4A ) . In patient cells , the turnover of clathrin-coated pits was reduced , as revealed by a significant increase in the number of long-lived pits and a reduction of short-lived ones ( short: 22 . 3% , medium: 42 . 3% , long: 35 . 4% ) ( Figure 4B ) . This phenotype was rescued by the re-expression of wild type OCRL ( short: 33 . 8% , medium: 49 . 9% , long: 16 . 3% ) ( Figure 4C ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 009Figure 4 .

The signal for OCRL then rapidly disappears as the free vesicle moves away from the imaging plane . The same pattern can be observed in patients cells rescued with OCRLWT ( F ) , while in patient cells expressing OCRLD523G , clathrin lingers for longer times even after the recruitment of OCRL , leading to a substantial overlap of red and green spots ( E ) .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 009 Confocal microscopy was also used to examine control and patient cells transfected with mRFP-tagged clathrin light chain ( mRFP-CLC ) and either wild type or a catalytically inactive GFP-tagged OCRL ( GFP-OCRLWT or GFP-OCRLD523G ) . In control cells , GFP-OCRLWT was recruited to clathrin spots as the clathrin fluorescence started to diminish ( Figure 4D; Video 2 ) , in agreement with previous observations ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . The signal for OCRL then rapidly disappeared as the free vesicle moved away from the imaging plane . In patient cells , the dynamics of the pits were disrupted , as demonstrated by the longer persistence of the clathrin signal ( Figure 4E; Video 3 ) . GFP-OCRLWT restored normal clathrin turnover in these cells ( Figure 4F; Video 4 ) , while GFP -OCRLD523G failed to do so despite being recruited to the pits and remaining associated with them ( Figure 4E; Video 3 ) . Delayed turnover in patient cells resulted in an increase in the number of clathrin puncta ( mRFP-tagged CLC ) that were positive for GFP-OCRLD523G at any given time ( Figure 4G ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 010Video 2 .

Lowe syndrome patient fibroblast co-transfected with the GFP-OCRLWT and RFP-CLC showing the rescue of clathrin and OCRL dynamics at the pit in the presence of exogenously expressed wild type OCRL . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 012 To assess the stage at which endocytic clathrin-coated pits were stalled in patient fibroblasts , electron microscopy was performed ( Figure 4H ) . This analysis confirmed the global increase in the number of clathrin-coated endocytic profiles and , in particular , a prominent increase of wide-neck ( primarily U-shaped ) pits and of free clathrin-coated vesicles in the cortical region of the cell ( less than 500 nm from the plasma membrane , that is clathrin-coated vesicles most likely of endocytic origin ) ( Figure 4H ) . These results suggest that the loss of OCRL impairs uncoating , a finding consistent with its very late recruitment at pits . Its absence also delays late steps in clathrin-mediated endocytosis , possibly as a result of sequestration of endocytic factors on uncoated vesicles . Such findings prompted us to assess the potential occurrence in patient cells of a defect in the internalization of transferrin , a well established cargo of clathrin-mediated endocytosis . Confocal microscopy of cells pre-incubated with fluorescent transferrin revealed a delay in the shift of fluorescence from the cell surface to deeper positions in the cytoplasm in patient cells compared to control fibroblasts ( Figure 4I\u2013J ) . This defect was quantified and confirmed biochemically by measuring the uptake of biotinylated transferrin at various time points during a 20-min time course ( Figure 4K ) . In addition , biotin labeling of the endogenous surface pool of the transferrin receptor showed its accumulation at the plasma membrane in patient cells compared to controls ( Figure 4L ) . From these results , we conclude OCRL is required for normal dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis . A reported phenotype of Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts is an abnormal organization of actin , with the presence of numerous actin comets ( Suchy and Nussbaum , 2002; Allen , 2003; Hayes et al . , 2009; Cui et al . , 2010; Dambournet et al . , 2011; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Accordingly , analysis of F-actin in control and patient cells using either phalloidin ( in fixed cells ) or mCherry-CHUTR ( in live cells ) ( Burkel et al . , 2007 ) revealed a reduction in the number of actin stress fibers , with the prominent accumulation of peripheral actin foci and actin comets ( also referred to as actin tails ) in patient cells ( Figure 5A\u2013B; Video 5 ) . These comets , which are dependent on N-WASP and the Arp2\/3 complex ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F ) , are thought to reflect the nucleation of actin on intracellular vesicles that ectopically accumulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 due to the lack of OCRL ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with this possibility , expression of GFP-OCRLWT suppressed the comets ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I\u2032 ) , while expression of catalytically-inactive GFP-OCRLD523G localized to the head of the comets but failed to rescue this phenotype ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1J\u2013J\u2032; Video 6 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 013Figure 5 .

Lowe syndrome patient fibroblast co-transfected with the F-actin probe mCherry-CHUtrophin and the catalytic dead GFP-OCRLD523G showing that the machinery necessary to recruit OCRL is present on the vesicles at the tip of the comets . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 017 Further analysis of proteins at the head of the comets revealed the presence of late-stage endocytic clathrin coat components and their accessory factors , including clathrin , AP-2 , SNX9 , SNX18 , and PI3KcII\u03b1 , as well as transferrin , a known cargo of clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( Figure 5C; Video 7 ) . Nearly every actin tail propelled vesicles positive for these proteins ( Figure 5D ) . This was also the case for endogenous proteins , as revealed by the presence of SNX9 and clathrin light chain immunoreactivity at the tips of comets labeled by phalloidin ( an F-actin marker ) ( Figure 5E ) . The tips of these comets however , were mostly devoid of endosomal markers , such as Rab5 or the FYVE domain of HRS ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1K\u2013L ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 018Video 7 . SNX9 is found on vesicles pushed by actin comets . Lowe syndrome patient fibroblast co-transfected with the F-actin probe mCherry-CHUtrophin and GFP-SNX9 revealing the presence of this endocytic factor on the vesicles at the tip of the comets . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 018 The levels of SNX9 were strikingly increased in patient cells ( Figure 5F\u2013G ) , possibly due to its accumulation and thus sequestration at comet tips . This may also explain the great increase of SNX9 punctate immunoreactivity in patient cells previously mentioned ( Figure 3I\u2013J ) . In contrast , the overall cellular levels of clathrin and AP-2 were similar in control and patient cells ( Figure 5F ) . However , an increase in the pool of assembled clathrin coats in patient cells was demonstrated biochemically ( Figure 5H\u2013I ) . Homogenization of cells under conditions known to preserve assembled clathrin , followed by high-speed centrifugation to yield cytosol ( C ) and total particulate ( P ) fractions , revealed an increased fraction of clathrin heavy chain in the particulate fraction of patient cells ( Figure 5H\u2013I ) . Thus , the coat and cargo of the intracellular actin-propelled vesicles are very similar to those of endocytic clathrin-coated pits . This supports the idea that vesicles at comet tips are endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles whose coat failed to shed due to the lack of OCRL catalytic activity . A small subset of vesicles driving the comets were larger than would be expected from endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles and may represent micropinosomes . Given the striking increase of SNX9 levels in patient cells and its known role in coordinating clathrin-coated pits maturation with actin nucleation ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) , we explored its importance in the formation of actin tails . Knockdown of SNX9 followed by immunostaining with phalloidin revealed a decrease in the number of endogenous comets observed in patient cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . There was noticeable cell-to-cell variability however , roughly correlating with residual SNX9 levels in knockdown cells ( generally higher in patient cells given the elevated basal level of this protein ) . Importantly , most of the remaining SNX9 puncta observed in cells after knockdown associated with the tips of the comets ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . These results suggest that the interaction between SNX9 and OCRL may help coordinate actin polymerization at late stage clathrin-coated pits with the turnover of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . The recruitment of OCRL to clathrin-coated pits was not dependent on its interaction with SNX9 , however . This was evidenced by the expression of an SNX9-binding mutant construct of OCRL ( GFP-OCRLP3 ) that still localized to clathrin-coated pits in patient cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Given the interactions of OCRL with several prominent endocytic factors such as clathrin and AP-2 , it is highly likely that multiple binding partners regulate its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits . If actin comets are in fact nucleated by plasma membrane-derived PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 still present on uncoated endocytic vesicles due to the absence of OCRL , depletion of plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 should result in their progressive disappearance . Alternatively , if comets are generated by the synthesis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on intracellular structures , depletion of plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 would not affect them . In order to discern between these two scenarios , we selectively depleted PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane via the activation of a PLC-coupled receptor , the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( M1R ) . Patient cells co-expressing untagged M1R , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 probe GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 and the F-actin reporter mCherry-CHUTR were analyzed by dual-color time-lapse confocal microscopy while an agonist ( OxoM ) , and subsequently an antagonist ( atropine ) , were added during live acquisition . Prior to OxoM addition , GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 was selectively localized at the plasma membrane , as typically observed for this PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 biosensor in resting cells ( Figure 6A ) . The addition of OxoM triggered PLC-mediated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 hydrolysis into IP3 and diacyl glycerol , which resulted in the relocation of GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 to the cytosol , indicating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 depletion at the plasma membrane ( Figure 6A ) . This change correlated with a transient increase of cytosolic Ca2+ , as expected ( Figure 6C; Horowitz et al . , 2005 ) . In turn , this led to a massive transient depolymerization of actin , including actin comets , and a sharp increase in the diffuse cytosolic fluorescence of the actin reporter , mCherry-CHUTR ( Figure 6B\u2013D ) . Subsequently , as Ca2+ levels reverted to the baseline level ( Figure 6C ) , actin comets reformed ( Figure 6B\u2013D ) , often reemerging at sites where they had previously disappeared ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This suggested that vesicles driving the comets had retained actin-nucleating properties during the transient actin depolymerization . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 019Figure 6 .

The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 reporter ( GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 ) shifts reversibly from the cell periphery to the cytosol in response to OxoM . mCherry-CHUtrophin foci represent actin comets that transiently disassemble during the Ca2+ peak , reassemble , and then gradually disappear as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is depleted leading to impaired endocytosis .

Comets reemerge from the same sites following transient actin depolymerization . ( A\u2013C ) Frames from a patient cell co-expressing mCherry-CHUtrophin and untagged M1R and exposed to OxoM at time zero .

( D ) Merge of the frames shown in ( A ) and ( C ) revealing that actin foci reemerge in the same place ( white arrowhead ) or in extremely close proximity ( yellow arrowhead ) to where comets were located before actin depolymerization . This indicates that the nucleating vesicles are still present and do not move significant distances during the Ca2+-induced actin depolymerization , and are capable of re-nucleating actin comets once Ca2+ levels in the cytosol return to baseline . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 020 In the continued presence of OxoM ( conditions where plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 remains depleted ) , reappearance of the comets after the Ca2+-induced actin depolymerization was followed by their progressive loss ( Figure 6B , D; Video 8 ) . Termination of the OxoM signal by addition of its antagonist , atropine , led to the rapid reformation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane ( Figure 6A ) and to a striking progressive recovery of the number of new comets rocketing throughout the cytosol ( Figure 6B , D; Video 8 ) . These results are consistent with the idea that the bulk of the vesicles found at the tip of actin comets are newly formed endocytic vesicles originating from the plasma membrane . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 021Video 8 . Selective depletion of plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 abolishes the comets . Lowe syndrome patient fibroblast co-transfected with the F-actin probe mCherry-CHUtrophin , GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 ( not shown ) and the untagged muscarinic receptor M1R . The cell is treated with 10 \u00b5M OxoM at 1m44s , which stays in the imaging media for the duration of the acquisition , followed by 50 \u00b5M atropine at 7m24s . Upon the addition of OxoM there's a rapid depolymerization of F-actin due to a rise in cytosolic calcium followed by the rapid reformation of the comets . Upon the continued presence of OxoM however , the comets gradually disappear due to the continued depletion of plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . This effect is reversed upon the addition of the antagonist Atropine , which allows the reformation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane , leading to the resurgence of the actin comets . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 021 The observations described thus far suggest a scenario in which the lack of OCRL-mediated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 hydrolysis results in a delay of endocytosis and impaired uncoating of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles . They further suggest that coated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2-rich vesicles drive actin nucleation . This hypothesis , however , contrasts with the very infrequent detection of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 probe , GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 , at the tip of comets ( Figure 7A , inset ) . This was particularly evident in images through the middle of the cell revealing the robust presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane but not intracellularly ( Figure 7A ) . Even a higher sensitivity probe , consisting of two tandem PH domains of PLC\u03b4 ( GFP-2XPHPLC\u03b4 ) yielded similar results . The difference in GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 labeling of comet tips and of the plasma membrane was even more striking on images of the bottom plane of a cell showing intracellular comets that encountered the plasma membrane and evaginated it into filopodia-like structures , akin to those generated by Listeria-driven comets ( Figure 7B , D; Video 9 ) . In this case , the heavy labeling of the plasma membrane of filopodia encapsulating the actin comet stood in striking contrast to the lack of labeling ( or very weak labeling ) of the vesicle at the tip of the comet . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 02975 . 022Figure 7 .

Overexpression of one such enzyme , PIPkinase type-1-gamma ( PIPK1\u03b3 ) , along with GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 and mCherry-CHUTR in control human fibroblasts cells led to a robust formation of actin comets ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013A\u2033 ) . Even in this case , where the intracellular pool of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was dramatically expanded , detection of GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 labeling at the tips of the comets ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B ) was inconsistent ( although more frequently observed than in Lowe syndrome patient cells ) , in contrast to the robust labeling of the plasma membrane ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013C\u2034 ) . This finding could have three non-mutually exclusive explanations: ( 1 ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 may be present at a much lower concentration on the vesicles than on the plasma membrane , but these low levels may be sufficient to nucleate actin , ( 2 ) GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 may be a better reporter of plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 given the presence of a yet unidentified PHPLC\u03b4 co-receptor only on this membrane; ( 3 ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 present on the vesicles may be shielded and possibly sequestered by actin and actin regulatory proteins . One observation favoring the idea that actin and actin regulatory proteins may shield\/sequester PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 came from patient cells overexpressing M1R and treated with OxoM . In such cells , several vesicles became positive for GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 during the period of actin depolymerization that accompanied the transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ ( Figure 7C ) . However , GFP-PHPLC\u03b4 was rapidly displaced by mCherry-CHUTR as actin comets reformed , providing further evidence for the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on internal vesicles in Lowe syndrome patient cells ( Figure 7C ) . Overall , these findings support a model in which OCRL acts at late-stage clathrin-coated pits to dephosphorylate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and facilitates the shedding of endocytic factors ( Figure 7D ) . In the absence of OCRL , as in Lowe syndrome , the accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2-rich vesicles that fail to lose their clathrin coat leads to an endocytic defect resulting from the sequestration of endocytic factors on these vesicles ( Figure 7D ) . \n Enzymes containing a 5-phosphatase domain have been implicated at multiple stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis , from clathrin coat nucleation to uncoating ( Pirruccello and De Camilli , 2012 ) . While OCRL , which directly interacts with clathrin , had been detected at late stage clathrin-coated pits ( Erdmann et al . , 2007; Mao et al . , 2009 ) , so far there has been no evidence from loss-of-function studies for a direct impact of this enzyme on the dynamics of endocytic clathrin-mediated budding . Data concerning the action of OCRL in membrane traffic , and the impact of its loss in patient cells , pointed primarily to a post-endocytic role , including intracellular clathrin-dependent transport reactions ( Dressman et al . , 2000; Ungewickell et al . , 2004; Choudhury et al . , 2005; Hyvola et al . , 2006; Swan et al . , 2010; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Additional roles for OCRL in clathrin-independent forms of endocytosis ( micropinocytosis and phagocytosis ) had also been reported ( Bohdanowicz et al . , 2012; Kuhbacher et al . , 2012; Marion et al . , 2012 ) . Our present results demonstrate that the absence of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patient cells results in an impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis . These findings provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of endocytosis as well as into the molecular pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease . A role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dephosphorylation in the normal progression of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was first described at neuronal synapses , where studies of synaptojanin 1 emphasized an uncoating function of this protein ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . Subsequent work in a variety of model systems supported this idea but also suggested a role of this phosphoinositide in the late stages of endocytosis . Dephosphorylation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in the membranes of the budding vesicles was proposed to act as a mechanism to generate a line tension at the vesicle neck ( Stefan et al . , 2002; Rusk et al . , 2003; Mani et al . , 2007; Sun et al . , 2007; Liu et al . , 2009; Chang-Ileto et al . , 2011 ) . Progression through the late stages of endocytosis could be also affected by the sequestration of endocytic proteins on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2-rich uncoated vesicles , as postulated for synapses lacking synaptojanin 1 or all three endophilins ( Mani et al . , 2007; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . The present study demonstrates a defect of endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts . This defect is characterized by an accumulation of late-stage ( primarily U-shaped ) endocytic clathrin-coated pits and by a delay in the internalization of transferrin , a clathrin-coated pit cargo . Our results also point to a defect in clathrin uncoating , as in the case of synaptojanin 1 KO synapses . More specifically , electron microscopy demonstrated a robust increase in the number of clathrin-coated vesicles in patient cells relative to control fibroblasts . Additionally , immunofluorescence and live microscopy analysis revealed an abundance of intracellular vesicles positive for both coat and cargo proteins of endocytic origin including , besides clathrin , the adaptor complex AP-2 , SNX9 , PI3KcII\u03b1 and transferrin . These vesicles were at the tips of actin comets , which are known to be nucleated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2-positive organelles . The dramatic decrease in the number of these comets upon the selective , pharmacologically-induced depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane demonstrates that at least a large cohort of these comets are nucleated by endocytic vesicles . The prominent impact of the lack of OCRL on total cellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels in patient cells is reminiscent of the robust increase in brain levels of this phosphoinositide observed in the absence of synaptojanin 1 ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . We suggest that synaptojanin 1 and OCRL have partially overlapping functions , but with predominant roles at synapses and in non-neuronal cells , respectively . The newly discovered direct interaction of OCRL with SNX9 , a protein implicated in the transition from late stage clathrin-coated pits to free clathrin-coated vesicles , is of significant interest as it provides a new link between OCRL function and late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pit nucleation . Interestingly , SNX9 also binds synaptojanin 1 and 2 , consistent with a partial overlap in the function of these 5-phosphatases ( Yeow-Fong et al . , 2005 ) . SNX9 is a member of a family of BAR domain-containing endocytic adaptors that help coordinate changes in bilayer curvature with reactions that occur as membranes progress along the endocytic pathway . Specifically , SNX9 is thought to have an important role in coupling clathrin coat maturation to actin nucleation ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . Our observation that the knockdown of SNX9 decreases comet formation in patient cells supports a role for this protein in actin nucleation at clathrin-coated pits . It also suggests a functional link between SNX9-regulated actin polymerization and the turnover of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 controlled by OCRL . The modular structure of SNX9 is ideally suited to mediate this coordination . SNX9 binds the plasma membrane with a PX-BAR domain module , which exhibits a preference for curved membranes enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides ( Gallop et al . , 2013 ) , clathrin via a \u2018clathrin-box\u2019 motif and AP-2 via an \u03b1-adaptin-binding motif ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003 ) . Through its SH3 domain , SNX9 binds and thus helps to activate both N-WASP to trigger actin nucleation , and dynamin to mediate fission ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . The SH3 domain of SNX9 binds synaptojanin and also OCRL , as we have demonstrated in this study . Given that SNX9 is a protein dimer that is present in multiple copies at endocytic sites , SNX9 is an attractive candidate to help bring together all these factors . Recently , SNX9 was shown to act as an effector of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , which is generated at endocytic clathrin-coated pits by PI3KcII\u03b1 ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . In principle , 5-phosphatases such as OCRL and synaptojanin could directly contribute to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 production by dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , or indirectly by generating PI4P , the PI3KcII\u03b1 substrate , from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 dephosphorylation ( Posor et al . , 2013; Schmid and Mettlen , 2013 ) . These models would place OCRL upstream of SNX9 . However , SNX9 is recruited to coated pits prior to OCRL , and also in its absence . Instead , the recruitment of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits coincides with the temporal recruitment signature of GAK ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , which , like its homologue auxilin , is a cofactor for Hsc70 and thus a key player in the disassembly of the clathrin lattice after fission ( Fotin et al . , 2004; Massol et al . , 2006 ) . Both OCRL and GAK peak after the clathrin fluorescence has started to diminish , as expected for proteins that mediate the shedding of the clathrin coat ( GAK ) and its adaptors ( OCRL ) . Interestingly , the lack of GAK or auxilin results in endocytic defects in addition to the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and empty clathrin cages ( Lee et al . , 2005 , Yim et al . , 2005 ) . This impairment of endocytosis is thought to result from the sequestration of coat components on assembled lattices . Similarly , a defect in uncoating in the absence of OCRL may impair the recycling of endocytic factors and affect the maturation of clathrin-coated pits . As OCRL binds multiple proteins present in endocytic clathrin coats , an important question for future studies will be to determine the precise mechanisms responsible for the timing of OCRL recruitment . The presence in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts of numerous actin comets driven by clathrin-positive vesicles adds further support to a close relationship between endocytic clathrin coats and actin , a topic of intense debate , although most recent studies support such a link at least for a major subset of clathrin-dependent endocytic events ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000; Merrifield et al . , 2002 , 2005; Boucrot et al . , 2006; Kaksonen et al . , 2006; Tsujita et al . , 2006; Ferguson et al . , 2009; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Actin has been implicated in both the invagination of clathrin-coated pits as well as in the propulsion of endocytic vesicles away from endocytic sites . The occurrence of comets in Lowe syndrome cells suggests that failure to dephosphorylate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 not only delays coat shedding , but also disrupts the release of actin nucleating factors associated with endocytic clathrin coats . The collective information emerging from this and previous studies suggests that the function of OCRL is needed , either directly or indirectly , at a multiplicity of sites . The 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL is required to complete endocytosis and to prevent the ectopic accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on endosomes and membranes in the Golgi complex area ( this work; Choudhury et al . , 2005; Dressman et al . , 2000; Erdmann et al . , 2007; Hyvola et al . , 2006; Swan et al . , 2010; Ungewickell et al . , 2004; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . This multiplicity of actions is supported by its numerous interactors , which comprise proteins implicated in membrane traffic , signaling and actin regulation in a variety of cellular compartments ( Pirruccello and De Camilli , 2012 ) . As shown here , proteins implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis are prominently featured in the OCRL \u2018interactome\u2019 , which also comprises numerous proteins that participate in the clathrin-dependent traffic between endosomes and the Golgi complex . These include the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor ( CI-M6PR ) and the clathrin adaptor EpsinR , implicating OCRL in these trafficking stations as well . It remains unclear whether the function of OCRL at these intracellular sites is to prevent the buildup of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 or to control small yet physiologically relevant PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 pools . A surprising result of our study was the unexpected absence of a robust signal for the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 probe , PHPLC\u03b4 , at intracellular sites in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts . The presence of clathrin , AP-2 and actin nucleating proteins on intracellular vesicles , however , strongly suggests the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on these vesicles . Sequestration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 on such vesicles by clathrin adaptors and actin nucleating factors may be one reason explaining absent or inefficient PHPLC\u03b4 labeling , as we have shown that transient depolymerization of actin results in the appearance of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 reporter on intracellular vesicles . OCRL has a close homologue , INPP5B , and these two proteins share many common interactors including endosomal proteins and Rabs ( Shin et al . , 2005; Hyvola et al . , 2006; Erdmann et al . , 2007; Fukuda et al . , 2008 ) . INPP5B however , does not contain either clathrin or AP-2 binding sites ( Ungewickell et al . , 2004; Choudhury et al . , 2005 ) . Correspondingly , OCRL and INPP5B share similar localizations on endosomes and in the Golgi complex area but INPP5B is not present at endocytic clathrin-coated pits ( Erdmann et al . , 2007; Williams et al . , 2007; Mao et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , a major functional difference between OCRL and INPP5B seems to be the involvement of OCRL , but not of INPP5B , in clathrin-mediated endocytosis . One important open question is why the lack of OCRL produces major phenotypes in humans but not in mice , in spite of the conservation of all known properties of OCRL in mice and humans , including the SNX9 binding site reported here . As INPP5B does not participate in endocytic clathrin-coated dynamics , differences in the expression or splicing of INPP5B in mice and humans cannot fully account for this difference . Elucidating mechanisms underlying this difference represents an important goal of future studies . Previous studies had attributed the proximal tubule reabsorption defects occurring in Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease primarily to abnormal endosomal recycling , such as for example the recycling of megalin , the scavenger receptor that mediates low molecular weight protein endocytosis , and CI-M6PR ( Erdmann et al . , 2007; Vicinanza et al . , 2011; Mehta et al . , 2014 ) . Our findings suggest that endocytosis itself may also be affected , as shown previously for CLC5 mutations that produce Dent's disease ( Novarino et al . , 2010 ) although they do not exclude the previously suggested intracellular sorting abnormalities ( Lowe , 2005; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Rather , they suggest that defects in endocytosis and in the fate of newly formed endocytic vesicles ultimately contribute to abnormal cargo sorting , as exemplified by the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the tip of actin comets . Impairments in endocytosis may also contribute to the cognitive deficiencies observed in Lowe syndrome patients . While synaptojanin 1 is the key player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at synapses , OCRL may function at clathrin-coated pits that participate in a housekeeping form of endocytosis in neurons . \n GFP-Rab5 , mRFP-clathrin light chain ( mRFP-CLC ) , GFP-N-Wasp , GFP-OCRL , catalytically inactive GFP-OCRLD523G , deletion fragments GST-OCRL176 and GST-OCRL217 and clathrin-binding mutant GFP-OCRLX3 have been described previously ( Perera et al . , 2006; Erdmann et al . , 2007; Ferguson et al . , 2009; Mao et al . , 2009; Idevall-Hagren et al . , 2012 ) . mCherry-tagged OCRL was generated by excising the OCRL coding sequence from GFP\u2010OCRL and ligating it into the pmCherry\u2010C1 vector ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . , Mountain View , CA ) using XhoI and BamHI . Three prolines in OCRL ( P177 , P178 and P181 ) were mutated to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis ( QuickChange II-XL; Agilent Technology , Santa Clara , CA ) and GFP-OCRL as the original template to generate GFP-OCRLP3 . The following primers were used: OCRL-P177 , 78 , 81A_S 5\u2032-GGGATTCATCGGGAAGCCGCACCTCCAGCCTTTTCAGT-3\u2032 and OCRL-P177 , 78 , 81A_AS 5\u2032-ACTGAAAAGGCTGGAGGTGCGGCTTCCCGATGAATCCC-3\u2032 .

Transferrin-Alexa 488 and 594 as well as biotinylated transferrin were purchased from Molecular Probes ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Avidin , biocytin , OxoM and Atropine were obtained from Sigma ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) and the Arp2\/3 inhibitor CK-666 was purchased from Calbiochem ( EMD Millipore Corporation , Billerica , MA ) .

Louis , MO ) , rabbit anti-clathrin light chain 4045 ( EMD Millipore Corporation , Billerica , MA ) , mouse anti-clathrin heavy chain TD1 ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) , mouse anti-alpha adaptin AP6 ( Affinity BioReagents , Golden , CO ) , rabbit anti-EpsinR\/CLINT1 ( Bethyl Laboratories , Montgomery , TX ) , mouse anti-GAPDH ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) , rabbit anti-GFP ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) , rabbit anti-p34 ( EMD Millipore Corporation , Billerica , MA ) , mouse anti-Transferrin receptor , goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 , goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 and Alex Fluor 594-phalloidin ( Life Technologies , Calsbad , CA ) . Rabbit anti-SNX9 for immunoblotting was generated in our lab , while rabbit anti-SNX9 for immunofluorescence were kind gifts from Sven Carlsson ( Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 , Sweden ) and Sandra Schmid ( UT Southwestern , Dallas , TX ) . De-identified human dermal fibroblasts derived from punch biopsies as well as HeLa M and HEK293 cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 10% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 mg\/ml penicillin\/streptomycin ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . For imaging , HeLa M and human wild type or patient fibroblasts were electroporated with Amaxa Nucleofector method using solution R\/program A-24 ( Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) . Cells were plated at subconfluent densities into 35 mm glass bottom ( thickness = 0 . 17 mm ) dishes ( Mattek , Ashland , MA ) and cultured for 12 to 24 hr prior to imaging . Control or patient cells seeded at day 0 were transfected with siRNAs using RNAiMax ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer's instructions , expanded on day 1 , and used for the experiment on day 3 . All siRNAs sequences were used as a 27-mers DsiRNAs ( IDT , Coralville , IA ) . The SNX9 sequence used was: 5\u2032-AACAGTCGTGCTAGTTCCTCATCCA-3\u2032 . For silencing SNX18 , the sequence used was: 5\u2032-GCACCGACGAGAAAGCCTGGAAGCA-3\u2032 . The negative control was a previously validated sequence provided by IDT DNA: 5\u2032-CGTTAATCGCGTATAATACGCGTAT-3\u2032 . HeLa M cells were transfected with either GFP-OCRL or pEGFP-C1 ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . , Mountain View , CA ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . 24 hr post-transfection , cells were plated into selection medium containing 750 \u00b5g\/ml G418 Sulphate ( Gibco BRL , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Following antibiotic selection , high and low GFP-expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting ( FACS ) and plated at low density to facilitate clonal colony formation . Individual colonies were picked , passaged directly into glass-bottom 35 mm dishes ( Mattek Corporation , Ashland , MA ) and imaged by SDC microscopy 15\u201324 hr later to assess the expression level , localization and dynamics of GFP-OCRL . Selected colonies were cultured and samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Odyssey quantitative western blotting ( LI-COR Biotechnology , Lincoln , NE ) . Rabbit anti-OCRL antibody ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was used to assess the ratio of exogenous GFP-OCRL to endogenous OCRL , which was then normalized to tubulin levels using mouse anti-tubulin antibody ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde-0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate . They were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in 1 . 5% K4Fe ( CN ) 6 and 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , en bloc stained with 0 . 5% uranyl magnesium acetate , dehydrated and embedded in Embed 812 . Electron microscopy reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences ( Hatfield , PA ) . For morphometric analysis , cells whose entire perimeter was visible in the EM sections were selected and all clathrin-coated structures , including clathrin-coated vesicular profiles within 500 nm of the plasma membrane , were counted . The total number of coated structures per unit length of the plasma membrane of each cell was calculated and averages of 30 control and patient cells were obtained . Cells were grown on 5 \u00b5g\/ml fibronectin ( Millipore ) coated glass coverslips and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 2 . Coverslips were washed with 50 mM NH4Cl , pH 7 . 2 , blocked and permeabilized with PBS + 3% bovine serum albumin + 0 . 1% Triton X-100 . Subsequent primary and secondary antibody incubations were also performed in this buffer . Coverslips were finally mounted in the Prolong Gold antifade reagent ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Samples were imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy . Multicolor images were acquired sequentially through a 60\u00d7 oil objective ( 1 . 4 NA , CFI Plan Apochromat VC ) at 1-min intervals , and at least 10 frames were acquired before the addition of compound . All imaging experiments were performed on a spinning-disc confocal ( SDC ) microscope , using the Improvision UltraVIEW VoX system ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) built around a Nikon Ti-E Eclipse microscope equipped with Perfect Focus , 14-bit electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera ( C9100-50; Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu , SZK , Japan ) , and spinning disc-confocal scan head ( CSU-X1; Yokogawa Corporation of America , Sugar Land , TX ) controlled by Volocity software ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . Green fluorescence was excited with a 488-nm\/50-mW diode laser ( Coherent ) and collected by a band pass ( BP ) 527\/55-nm filter . Red fluorescence was excited with a 561-nm\/50-mW diode laser ( Cobolt ) and collected by a BP 615\/70-nm filter . Total internal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Ti-E Eclipse inverted microscope fitted with an Apo TIRF 100 \u00d7 N . A . 1 . 49 oil objective and driven by Andor iQ software ( Andor Technologies , Belfast , Ireland ) . Images were acquired with a back-illuminated Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera ( 512 \u00d7 512 , 14 bit; Andor Technologies ) . Cells were imaged by sequential excitation at 0 . 25 Hz . Post-acquisition image analysis was performed in ImageJ software ( 1 . 46j , NIH ) and GraphPad Prism . Fluorescent particle detection , lifetime tracking , and lifetime analysis of clathrin-coated pits in control and patient cells expressing GFP-tagged \u00b52 subunit of AP2 ( \u00b52-GFP ) was performed as previously described ( Liang et al . , 2014 ) . Patient cells were rescued by expressing mCherry-OCRLWT . For this analysis all images were acquired using TIRF microscopy . 12 control cells , 12 patient cells and 7 rescued patient cells were used and an average of 809 events per cell were analyzed . Only endocytic pits that appeared during the acquisition and with a lifetime of at least 12 s were selected . An automated tracking analysis was used to determine the lifetime distributions of \u00b52 puncta for each cell . Using expectation-maximization algorithms , a Gaussian mixture model was then fitted to each lifetime histogram independently , identifying three subpopulations ( short , medium and long lifetimes ) . The mean lifetimes of the three subpopulations across different cells were calculated ( 40 s , 108 s , and 244 s respectively ) , fixed and then Gaussian models using these means for each subpopulation were re-fitted to the histograms . Particle counting was conducted in ImageJ ( National Institutes Of Health , Bethesda , MD ) by thresholding and using the analyze particles plug-in . To examine the sequential recruitment of proteins at the pit , raw images were analyzed with ImageJ to generate intensity plots of areas of interest and to quantitate particles as described previously ( Perera et al . , 2006; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Briefly , average fluorescence\/time plots were generated from individual fluorescent spots , which were subsequently time\u2010aligned by the conversion of one fluorescent marker to another . For each time point , the fluorescence intensity was normalized to the peak fluorescence intensity of that pit . For these analyses , clathrin-coated pits were manually selected at random . Statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed Student's t test . Uptake of biotinylated transferrin was performed as previously described ( Yarar , et al . , 2005 ) with slight modifications . Briefly , control and patient cells were starved for 1 . 5 hs , then chilled on ice for 30 min and finally incubated with biotinylated transferrin ( 10 \u00b5g\/ml ) in ice-cold DMEM on ice for 45 min . Cells were then washed with cold PBS and incubated with pre-warmed culture media at 37\u00b0C for the times indicated . Internalization was stopped by placing the cells on ice and washing them three times with cold PBS . Cells were then incubated on ice with avidin ( 0 . 05 mg\/ml ) for 1 hr followed by incubation with biocytin ( 0 . 05 mg\/ml ) for 15 min . Cells were then washed three times with PBS and lysed ( 1% TX-100 , 0 . 1% SDS , 0 . 2% BSA , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 ) . Cell lysates were then added to ELISA plates coated with anti-human transferrin antibody ( Abcam ) and assayed for detectable biotinylated transferrin using chromogen-conjugated streptavidin as indicated in the manufacturer's protocol . In Figure 4K internalized biotinylated transferrin was expressed as the percent of total surface-bound at 4\u00b0C , which was not incubated with avidin or biocytin . Uptake of fluorescently label transferrin was performed in a very similar fashion , as previously described ( Ritter et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were incubated with transferrin-Alex 594 instead , placed on ice after internalization , washed three times with cold PBS , and surface bound transferrin was removed by a quick acid wash ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl ) . Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA and imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy . Cell were rinsed with PBS , labeled on ice for 60 min with 1 mg\/ml EZ-link Sulfo-NHS- SS-Biotin ( Thermo Scientific , Rockford , IL ) , rinsed with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 1% TX100 and 0 . 1%SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) . Biotinylated proteins were recovered on neutravidin beads ( Thermo Scientific ) and eluted by reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol containing SDS-PAGE sample buffer . Evaluation of transferrin receptor levels in starting material , biotinylated ( cell surface ) and non-biotinylated ( intracellular ) fractions was assessed by immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE . Actin immunoblotting ( mouse anti-actin antibody; Sigma ) was used as a negative control to ensure that the assay specifically distinguished between cell surface and intracellular proteins . Particulate and cytosolic fractions were purified from control and patient cells using ice-cold buffer A ( 100 mM MES , pH 6 . 5 , 1 mM EGTA , and 0 . 5 mM MgCl2 ) . Cells were harvested , pelleted , washed in PBS and repelleted . The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A , homogenized in a glass Teflon homogenizer , passed through a 25G , 5\/8 in needle and centrifuged for 5 min at 800\u00d7g in a tabletop centrifuge at 4\u00b0C . The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 1 hr at 60 , 000\u00d7g in a TLA 100 . 2 rotor at 4\u00b0C . The resulting supernatant ( cytosol ) and pellet ( particulate fraction ) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting . Recombinant NH2-terminal OCRL fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as GST-tagged fusions as previously described ( Mao et al . , 2009 ) . Fusion proteins were purified on glutathione Sepharose beads according to standard protocols . Adult mouse brain extracts were prepared by homogenization in lysis buffer ( PBS , 0 . 5% Triton [vol\/vol] , protease inhibitor mixture [Roche] ) followed by ultracentrifugation ( 100 , 000\u00d7g , 60 min , 4\u00b0C ) to remove insoluble material . Cleared lysates were then incubated with GST-fusion proteins on beads for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C . After extensive wash , bound proteins were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE . For co-immunoprecipitations , HEK 293 cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged constructs or HeLa cells stably expressing GFP alone or GFP-OCRL were collected and lysed in lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1% Triton X-100 , 1 mM EDTA , 200 U benzonase [Merck , Darmstadt , Germany] and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN] ) . Cell extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 4000\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C for 15 min . Cleared lysates ( 2\u20134 mg ) were incubated under rotation for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 50 \u00b5l magnetic beads or 25 \u00b5l sepharose beads coupled to monoclonal mouse anti\u2010GFP antibody ( Miltenyi Biotec Inc . , Auburn , CA ) . Following centrifugation and several washes in lysis buffer , proteins recovered on beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE . Analysis of phosphoinositides was performed by HPLC separation of glycerol-inositol phosphates after phospholipid deacylation and analysis of the mono- and bis-phosphate species by conductivity detection ( Nasuhoglu et al . , 2002 ) . Given that the bulk of cellular PIP2 and PIP are represented by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and PI ( 4 ) P respectively , the two peaks closely reflect the levels of these two phosphoinositides .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["cell biology"],"id":"elife-02975-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"When an embryo develops , its cells must work together and \u2018talk\u2019 with each other so they can build the tissues and organs of the body . A cell can communicate with its neighbors by producing a signal , also known as a morphogen , which will tell the receiving cells what to do . Once outside the cell , a morphogen spreads through the surrounding tissue and forms a gradient: there is more of the molecule closer to the signaling cells and less further away . The cells that receive the message respond differently depending on how much morphogen they get , and therefore on where they are placed in the embryo . How morphogens move in tissues to create gradients is still poorly understood . One hypothesis is that , once released , they spread passively through the space between cells . Instead , recent research has shown that some morphogens travel through long , thin cellular extensions known as cytonemes . These structures directly connect the cells that produce a morphogen with the ones that receive the molecule . Yet , it is still unclear how cytonemes can help to form gradients . Du et al . aimed to resolve this question by following a morphogen called Branchless as it traveled through fruit fly embryos . Branchless is important for sculpting the embryonic airway tissue into a delicate network of branched tubes which supply oxygen to the cells of an adult fly . However , no one knew how cells communicate Branchless , whether or not Branchless formed a gradient , and if it did , how this gradient was created to set up the plan to form airway tubes . It was assumed that the molecule would diffuse passively to reach airway cells \u2013 but this is not what the experiments by Du et al . showed . To directly observe how Branchless moves among cells , insects were genetically engineered to produce Branchless molecules attached to a fluorescent \u2018tag\u2019 . Microscopy experiments using these flies revealed that Branchless did not diffuse passively; instead , airway cells used cytonemes to \u2018reach\u2019 towards the cells that produced the molecule , collecting the signal directly from its source . The gradient was created because the airway cells near the cells that make Branchless had more cytonemes , and therefore received more of the molecule compared to the cells that were placed further away . Genetic analysis of the airway tissue showed that Branchless acts as a morphogen to switch on different genes in the receiving cells placed in different locations . The target genes activated by the gradient instruct the receiving cells on how many cytonemes need to be extended , which helps the gradient to maintain itself over time . Du et al . demonstrate for the first time how cytonemes can relay a signal to establish a gradient in a developing tissue . Dissecting how cells exchange information to create an organism could help to understand how this communication fails and leads to disorders .","article":"Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for inducing tissue morphogenesis . However , mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial . Here we characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins , FGF and FGFR , expressed at physiological levels from the genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila . FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium ( ASP ) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source . The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source , generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient . Acting as a morphogen in the ASP , FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression , inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels . The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes , creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes . These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion . \n Diverse tissue shapes and patterns are created by conserved paracrine signaling proteins such as Transforming Growth Factor \u03b2 ( TGF\u03b2 ) , Hedgehog ( Hh ) , Wingless ( Wg\/WNT ) , Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) and Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) . Irrespective of the diversity of the functions and forms created , a universal mode by which these signals coordinate responses in a large population of cells involves the generation of concentration gradients . For instance , morphogen gradients induce concentration-dependent gene activities that regulate tissue growth and patterning ( reviewed in ( Bier and De Robertis , 2015; Christian , 2012; Restrepo et al . , 2014; Rogers and Schier , 2011; Wolpert , 2016 ) ) . Similarly , growth factor and chemokine gradients are thought to control cell migration during vasculogenesis , neurogenesis , wound healing , and immune responses ( Cai and Montell , 2014; Majumdar et al . , 2014 ) . Despite advances in our understanding of signal transduction pathways , how signals disperse and how the dispersion mechanism is dynamically modulated to shape gradients in three-dimensional tissue structures are poorly understood . Moreover , the formation of signal gradients is unexplored in most morphogenetic contexts , so we do not know how dispersion of the signals through extracellular space can generate the required diversity in gradient shapes and contours for a multitude of tissue architectures . Several models primarily based on free\/restricted\/facilitated extracellular diffusion of signals were proposed previously to explain the establishment of signal gradients , but the proposed mechanisms are highly controversial ( Majumdar et al . , 2014; M\u00fcller et al . , 2013; Wolpert , 2016 ) . Recent advancements in live imaging technology facilitated the discovery of a radically different mechanism of signal dispersion , where signals move directly from producing to recipient cells through actin-based specialized filopodia or cytonemes ( Bischoff et al . , 2013; Eom and Parichy , 2017; Roy et al . , 2011b; Roy et al . , 2014; Sanders et al . , 2013; Stanganello and Scholpp , 2016 ) . Cytonemes and cytoneme-like projections are now known to be required for cell-cell communication mediated by many families of signaling proteins ( Kornberg , 2014 ) . For instance , a cytoneme-dependent mechanism was shown to be essential for generating concentration-dependent signaling responses to the Hh and Dpp morphogens ( Bischoff et al . , 2013; Chen et al . , 2017; Roy et al . , 2014 ) . However , how local cytoneme-mediated cell-to-cell communication might create long-range signal gradients to regulate tissue morphogenesis was unknown . In this study , we aimed to address these fundamental questions by characterizing gradient formation of a Drosophila FGF family protein , Branchless ( Bnl ) . In Drosophila , Bnl is the primary signal that guides the branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes ( Sutherland et al . , 1996 ) . At the third instar larval stage , Bnl produced from a restricted group of wing imaginal disc cells induces budding and growth of a wing disc-associated tracheal branch , the air-sac primordium ( ASP ) , from the disc-associated transverse connective ( TC ) ( Figure 1A ) ( Sato and Kornberg , 2002 ) . ASP tracheoblast cells are precursors of adult air-sac , an organ that is analogous to the vertebrate lung . Traditionally , all paracrine signals such as FGF family proteins are thought to function as diffusible signals and form a\u00a0gradient by passive extracellular dispersion . In accordance with the same line of thinking , one hypothesis predicts that Drosophila Bnl diffuses from its source to form an extracellular gradient and that the gradient guides directional migration of the tracheal branches such as the ASP ( Horowitz and Simons , 2008; Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter , 2012 ) ( Figure 1A\u2019 ) . However , whether Bnl forms a gradient and if so , how Bnl is transported and modulated in the extracellular space to form a gradient remain unexplored . Moreover , all tracheal cells express the Bnl receptor , Breathless ( Btl ) , and develop under the guidance of the same Bnl signal , but different embryonic and larval tracheal branches adopt different developmental stage-specific morphologies ( Sato and Kornberg , 2002; Sutherland et al . , 1996 ) . We do not understand whether and how the shape of a Bnl gradient can dynamically adapt to diverse tissue morphologies . To investigate these important gaps in knowledge , we chose to focus on the Drosophila larval ASP because of its unique features . In this system , the wing disc bnl-source is spatially separated from the recipient ASP epithelium ( Figure 1A\u201d ) . Bnl signals exclusively to the ASP because the wing disc cells and myoblasts located between the disc and the ASP do not express its receptor , Btl . Moreover , the two additional Drosophila FGF family proteins , Pyramus and Thisbe , do not share receptors with Bnl ( Sato and Kornberg , 2002; Stathopoulos et al . , 2004 ) . This system where there is a clear inter-organ communication path and a single Bnl-specific receptor exclusively expressed in the ASP is ideal for an unbiased interpretation of the extracellular route of Bnl transport and gradient formation . Genome-edited Bnl:GFP and Btl:Cherry constructs generated in this study revealed Bnl distribution with high sensitivity and precision , allowing direct visualization of an endogenous signal and signaling gradient . We showed that Bnl moves target-specifically from the producing cells to the ASP through cytonemes and forms a long-range concentration gradient by dynamically adopting the recipient ASP-specific shapes and contours . We also demonstrated that Bnl functions as a morphogen and , most importantly , we uncovered a novel self-regulatory mechanism of cytoneme-mediated signaling by which the Bnl morphogen gradient forms . Thus , these findings showed an example of morphogenesis in which cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time . \n To visualize Bnl dispersion without affecting normal tracheal morphogenesis , we employed the CRISPR\/Cas9-based genome-editing technique to generate flies that harbor an in-frame insertion of a superfolder-GFP ( sfGFP ) sequence within the third coding exon of the bnl gene ( Figure 1B; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C; Materials and methods ) . Animals that harbored the bnl:gfpendo knock-in allele were homozygous viable , had normal tissue morphology , and the expected gene expression patterns ( Du et al . , 2017; Sato and Kornberg , 2002 ) . Under sensitive confocal microscopy ( see Materials and methods ) , endogenous Bnl:GFP molecules were visualized as fluorescent puncta ( Figure 1C , C\u2019 ) . The distribution patterns of these Bnl:GFP puncta revealed several unexpected features . In the wing disc source cells that were marked by CherryCAAX expression , Bnl:GFP puncta were faint , hardly detectable , and homogeneously distributed ( Figure 1C\u2013D\u2019 ) . As a paracrine signal , Bnl was expected to disperse and form a continuous gradient surrounding the wing disc source ( Figure 1A\u2019 ) . However , all of the detectable bright fluorescent Bnl:GFP puncta outside of the source cells were asymmetrically distributed only in the recipient ASP cells ( Figure 1C\u2013D\u2019 ) . Thus , although Bnl:GFP moved from the wing disc source to the ASP , the punctate signal did not localize in the non-specific wing disc cells surrounding the signal source or in the myoblast cells located between the disc source and the ASP ( Videos 1 and 2 ) . To ensure that the GFP-marked puncta in the ASP were actual Bnl molecules , we performed an immunohistochemistry assay ( IHC ) with\u00a0\u03b1Bnl antibody on the homozygous bnl:gfpendo larval tissues . The Bnl antibody recognized all of the Bnl:GFP puncta in the larval ASP , confirming that they represent the Bnl protein ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A , A\u2019 ) . To further validate whether the Bnl:GFP distribution in the ASP represented a functional distribution of the ligand , we knocked-down bnl:gfpendo expression in the wing disc source . Since Bnl is essential for tracheal\/ASP growth ( Sutherland et al . , 1996; Sato and Kornberg , 2002 ) , loss of a functional Bnl:GFP distribution was expected to abrogate ASP development . As expected , overexpression of bnlRNAi from the disc bnl-source in the bnl:gfpendo larvae knocked down both Bnl:GFP expression and ASP growth in most samples , indicating that the tagged signaling protein is functional ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C ) . However , due to incomplete RNAi-mediated knock-down of bnl:gfpendo , a few samples still contained low levels of Bnl:GFP . Importantly , these samples also had small , stunted ASPs with a shallow range of Bnl:GFP distribution . This correlation between Bnl:GFP levels\/distribution and ASP growth suggested that the levels and distribution of Bnl:GFP in the ASP have a significant developmental role ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C ) . Contrary to what was predicted earlier ( Figure 1A\u2019; ( Horowitz and Simons , 2008; Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter , 2012 ) ) , our imaging results ( Figure 1C\u2013D\u2019 ) suggested that a pre-existing Bnl:GFP gradient surrounding the wing disc signal source was not formed . Instead , the Bnl:GFP puncta appeared to distribute in a graded pattern along the distal-to-proximal ( D-P ) axis of the recipient ASP ( Figure 1D , D\u2019 ) . Measurement of Bnl:GFP intensities along the longest D-P axis of the late third instar larval ASPs revealed a long-range exponential gradient spanning\u00a0~100\u2013120 \u03bcm in range . The distal ASP tip , which is nearest to the disc bnl-source , received the highest levels of Bnl:GFP ( Figure 1E ) . The signal concentration decreased exponentially toward the proximal ASP stalk as the distance from the source increased . Thus , although Bnl:GFP is produced in the wing disc , its gradient is formed in the recipient ASP . The Bnl:GFP gradient shapes were variable , and developed concomitantly with the growth of the recipient ASP ( Figure 1F ) . In the early third instar larval stage ( 18\u201326 hr after third\u00a0instar larval molt ) , the ASP was hardly detectable . At this stage , only a few TC cells proximal to the bnl-source had received Bnl:GFP . In the later stages , as the ASP budded from the TC and then elongated , the Bnl:GFP gradient shapes adopted the variable shapes of the recipient ASP . These results suggested that the shape of the Bnl:GFP gradient is adaptable and its formation is coordinated with growth of the recipient ASP . We further examined the relationship of the slope of the Bnl:GFP gradient with the length of the D-P axis of the recipient ASP . In the shorter early third instar larval ASPs ( ~35\u201340 hr after third instar larval\u00a0molt ) , Bnl:GFP formed relatively steeper and narrower gradients ( slope of a straight line joining Cmax to C1\/2max =~3 . 14 ) compared to the larger\/longer late-stage ASPs ( slope =~0 . 71 ) ( Figure 1E , G ) . A strong negative correlation of the gradient slopes with the length of the ASP D-P axis was also observed in a population of randomly harvested wandering third instar larval ASPs , which showed natural developmental variations in size ( Figure 1H ) . These results showed that the range and slope of the Bnl:GFP gradients are dependent on the ASP morphology and that the gradient did not pre-exist , but instead developed dynamically in coordination with the recipient tissue morphogenesis . Although 2D Z-projected images were sufficient to visualize the gradient in the X-Y plane , the ASP epithelium has a complex three-dimensional tubular morphology . As shown in the cross-section diagram of the ASP and wing disc in Figure 1A\u201d , the relative distance of the ASP cells from the disc source can be measured along the D-P axis as well as in the upper and lower layers across the vertical Z-axis . Across the Z-axis , most of the cells in the upper ASP layer ( ventral face ) were situated away from the underlying bnl-source . In spite of the physical distances , Bnl:GFP distribution was not restricted to the ASP cells that were immediately juxtaposed to the bnl-source . Instead , Bnl:GFP distributed in both layers formed a continuous long-range gradient , adopting the complex 3D tubular contour of the epithelium ( ~300 \u03bcm long , equivalent to 30 cells in just a single medial cross-section ) ( Figure 1I\u2013I\u201d ) . When we probed for the expression of a Bnl-signaling target gene pntP1 , an ETS family transcription factor ( Sutherland et al . , 1996 ) , overlapping signal and signaling gradients were revealed ( Figure 1I\u2013J , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E\u201d ) . Interestingly , in a digitally straightened continuous epithelium , the signal and signaling gradients had a bilateral symmetric distribution , where the positions with highest concentrations corresponded to the ASP cells nearest to the disc bnl-source ( Figure 1I\u2019 , I\u201d , J ) . Tubular contours of the ASP epithelium were variable among different samples , but irrespective of the differences in 3D morphologies , the Bnl:GFP distribution consistently adopted the recipient ASP-specific contours ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E\u201d ) . Collectively , these results showed that formation of the Bnl gradient depends on the ASP growth , and that the shapes of the gradient can dynamically adapt to the changing morphologies of the growing tissues . A trachea-specific Bnl:GFP gradient might reflect a receptor-bound signal distribution . To examine this possibility , we created animals harboring a btl:cherryendo knock-in allele using genome-editing technology ( Figure 2A; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C; Materials and methods ) . As expected , Btl:Cherry expressed at physiological levels marked all tracheal cells , but formed a concentration gradient along the D-P axis of the ASP ( Figure 2B; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . This observation is consistent with an earlier report describing activation of btl transcription by Bnl signaling ( Ohshiro et al . , 2002 ) . In trans-heterozygous btl:cherryendo\/bnl:gfpendo animals , all the Bnl:GFP puncta in the ASP colocalized with Btl:Cherry and the receptor gradient coincided with that of the ligand gradient ( Figure 2C\u2013D; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E , E\u2019 ) . Most of the colocalized receptor-ligand puncta were compartmentalized apically in early- ( \u03b1Rab5 IF;\u00a0~76% of total puncta\/ASP examined ) and late- ( \u03b1Rab7 IF;\u00a0~90% of total puncta\/ASP ) endosomes , but not in recycling endosomes or lysosomes ( Figure 2E\u2013E\u201d\u2019; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . These results suggested that the branch-specific Bnl:GFP gradient is receptor-bound , and mostly intracellular . Notably , a small number of receptor-ligand puncta were found at the basal side of ASP cells ( arrows in Figure 2C , E ) . They were located mostly at the distal ASP tip cells and did not colocalize with any of the endosomal markers we examined ( Figure 2E ) . These puncta on the exposed basal side of the ASP might represent Btl:Cherry-bound Bnl:GFP molecules prior to their receptor-mediated endocytosis . Bnl molecules were expected to move through the extracellular space from the wing disc source to the ASP . To clearly visualize the extracellular distribution pattern of post-secretory Bnl:GFP prior to their endocytosis in the ASP , we employed a standard detergent-free immunofluorescence ( EIF ) protocol ( see Materials and methods ) . This protocol was specifically developed for detecting extracellular dispersion profiles of morphogens ( Schwank et al . , 2011; Strigini and Cohen , 2000 ) . An \u03b1GFP EIF assay identified a distinct steady-state surface-bound extracellular\/externalized pool of Bnl:GFP molecules ( Figure 3A; henceforth referred as Bnl:GFPex ) . Interestingly , even though we used a highly sensitive Gallium arsenide phosphide detector for imaging ( see Materials and methods ) , endogenous levels of EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex puncta appeared to emit very weak GFP-fluorescence , which was rapidly quenched during high magnification ( 40X ) imaging . However , this property of GFP-tagged molecules enabled us to estimate the levels of externalized\/extracellular Bnl:GFP ( Bnl:GFPex ) , distinguishing them from the brightly fluorescent but non-EIF stained intracellular Bnl:GFP puncta in the ASP ( henceforth referred as Bnl:GFPin ) ( Figure 3A ) . Most importantly , this experiment showed that although the EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex molecules represented secreted signals in the extracellular space , they did not disperse randomly in all directions . Instead , they were asymmetrically localized and only detected on the surfaces of signal producing cells and of the recipient ASP ( Figure 3A , A\u2019 ) . Bnl:GFPex were highly enriched on the ASP and appeared to form a gradient on the recipient surface , in exactly the same way as the endocytosed Bnl:GFPin molecules ( Figure 3A\u201d ) . In contrast to the asymmetric Bnl:GFPex distribution , a secreted-GFP construct containing a sfGFP tag and an N-terminal signal peptide derived from the Bnl sequence ( secGFP; see Materials and methods ) randomly dispersed in the extracellular space surrounding the disc bnl-source ( Figure 3B\u2013B\u201d; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . These results showed that Bnl:GFP moved target-specifically in polarized fashion . The polarized distribution pattern of Bnl:GFPex was consistent with a potential cytoneme-mediated direct transport of the molecules . Previous studies showed that ASP cells project receptor-containing cytonemes to establish direct membrane contacts with the wing disc Bnl source . These cytonemes were shown to be essential for induction of pMAPK signaling in the ASP ( Roy et al . , 2014 ) . However , Bnl transport through cytonemes was never visualized before . To examine if Bnl:GFPex molecules localized on the surface of the ASP cytonemes , we carried out EIF assays with either \u03b1GFP or \u03b1Bnl antibody on CD8:Cherry-marked ASPs of bnl:gfpendo homozygous larvae . These assays showed that the EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex puncta were highly enriched on cytonemes emanating from the distal ASP\u00a0tip ( N\u00a0>\u00a050 ASP , Figure 3C\u2013E; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013B\u201d ) . However , as observed earlier , many of these puncta were poorly fluorescent under standard confocal fluorescence imaging conditions . Therefore , to clearly visualize the endogenous Bnl:GFP molecules on cytonemes , we employed an enhanced gain super-resolution detection method ( see Materials and methods ) . This imaging method revealed that the surfaces of the ASP and ASP cytonemes were densely populated with a high concentration of Bnl:GFP molecules , which appeared as small sub-resolution-sized puncta of\u00a0<200 nm in diameter ( henceforth referred as nanopuncta due to their sub-resolution size; arrowheads in Figure 3F\u2013F\u201d , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013A\u201d\u2019 ) . These nanopuncta were also enriched on the source cells , especially around the bouton-like sites of contact between the cytonemes and the source ( Figure 3F ) . An \u03b1GFP EIF staining assay in combination with super-resolution imaging showed that these Bnl:GFP nanopuncta included both surface-bound molecules ( EIF-stained ) and intracellular molecules ( non-EIF stained ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B , B\u2019 ) . Occasionally , several nanopuncta aggregated to form bright punctal clusters on the cytonemes , the fluorescence of which was likely to be easily detectable under our standard confocal fluorescence imaging conditions ( arrows in Figure 3F\u2019 , F\u201d ) . Although the molecular and cellular nature of the nanopuncta and their clusters on the cytonemes are unclear , these results provided substantial evidence for a selective distribution of Bnl:GFP molecules along the surface of cytonemes . Native , untagged Bnl could also be detected on cytoneme surfaces using the \u03b1Bnl antibody . The \u03b1Bnl EIF assay showed that a high concentration of externalized Bnl ( Bnlex ) molecules selectively decorate actin-rich ASP cytonemes and the ASP surface of w- wild-type larvae ( Figure 3G ) . The distribution of Bnlex was asymmetrical , exactly as observed for Bnl:GFP on CD8:Cherry-marked ASPs ( Figure 3C ) . These results suggested that Bnl molecules , irrespective of the presence or absence of fluorescent tags , specifically localize on the surface of the ASP cytonemes for inter-organ transport . Since efficient inter-tissue movement of Bnl molecules along the surface of the recipient cytonemes might require receptor binding , we imaged ASP cytonemes in btl:cherryendo larvae . Densely packed Btl:Cherry molecules were visualized on the surface of the ASP cytonemes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . An \u03b1Bnl-EIF assay in btl:cherryendo larvae showed that the native Bnlex puncta colocalized with the Btl:Cherry puncta on the cytonemes and on ASP surfaces ( Figure 3H ) . Receptor-bound Bnl:GFP puncta were also observed on cytonemes during live imaging ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C\u2019; N\u00a0=\u00a030 ) . Thus , Bnl is transported by cytonemes from the source to the ASP in a receptor-bound state . Cytonemes exchange signals by establishing direct physical contacts between the source and recipient cells ( Chen et al . , 2017; Gonz\u00e1lez-M\u00e9ndez et al . , 2017; Huang and Kornberg , 2015; Roy et al . , 2014 ) . These signaling contacts between the ASP and the bnl source were originally discovered using a membrane GFP-reconstitution method ( GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners , GRASP ) ( Huang and Kornberg , 2015; Roy et al . , 2014 ) . As shown in Video 3 , an improved GRASP technique , \u2018Synaptobrevin-GFP-reconstitution-across-synaptic-partners ( syb-GRASP ) \u2019 revealed multiple functional contact sites between each of the ASP cytonemes and the bnl-source . To estimate the contact-dependency of the cytoneme-mediated Bnl reception , we combined the syb-GRASP experiment with the \u03b1Bnl EIF assay . This experiment showed that the actin-rich ( phalloidin-stained ) ASP cytonemes that contacted the disc bnl-source received a significantly higher number of Bnlex puncta in comparison to the non-contacting cytonemes ( Figure 3I , I\u2019 ) . These observations , together with the previous reports on the effect of loss of cytoneme contacts on pMAPK signaling in the ASP ( Roy et al . , 2014 ) , provided substantial evidence that cytoneme-mediated Bnl exchange is contact-dependent . Molecular reconstitution of split GFP between ASP cytonemes and source cells suggested that the signaling contacts between the cytoneme and source cell membranes juxtapose within a 20 nm gap distance ( Kornberg and Roy , 2014 ) . To directly visualize and resolve Bnl exchange at these cytoneme contacts , an \u03b1Bnl EIF assay was combined with super-resolution imaging ( see Materials and methods ) of the tissues that had both the source and recipient ASP cells marked with distinct membrane-tagged proteins ( Figure 3J ) . The images revealed that ASP cytonemes traverse along the surface of the source cells , with each cytoneme establishing contacts with multiple signal-producing cells . Although the producing cells occupy a large area , the externalized Bnl proteins were specifically enriched at the cytoneme contact sites . This observation suggests that the producing cells selectively release Bnl at these contact sites . These ASP cytonemes also localized Bnlex puncta on their shafts , suggesting that the signal might be transported from the contact sites to the ASP along the surface of the cytonemes . A similar retrograde movement of Dpp was previously observed through ASP cytonemes ( Roy et al . , 2014 ) . To examine whether cytoneme-mediated reception of Bnl:GFP is essential for generating the long-range Bnl:GFP gradient in the ASP , we generated mosaics of marked cytoneme-deficient mutant clones within the ASP of bnl:gfpendo larvae by knocking down several known cytoneme-regulator genes such as diaphanous ( dia ) , a formin homolog , neuroglian ( nrg ) , an L1-cell adhesion molecule ( Roy et al . , 2014 ) , and singed ( sn ) , a Fascin homolog and a regulator of tracheal filopodia ( Okenve-Ramos and Llimargas , 2014 ) . To assess Bnl reception in the mutant clones , we compared Bnl:GFP levels within the mutant area ( inside of the clone ) with that in the wild-type ( WT ) neighboring areas at an equivalent position ( outside of the clone ) in the same ASP . The ratios of Bnl:GFP concentration outside to inside of the marked wild-type ( WT ) control clones were\u00a0~1 , suggesting no significant differences in the signal uptake within the marked ( inside ) and unmarked ( outside of the clone ) WT areas ( Figure 4A , E ) . However , knockdown of cytoneme-regulator genes in clones of cells significantly decreased Bnl:GFP levels in the mutant cells , but not in the neighboring WT cells ( Figure 4B\u2013E; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Consequently , the ratio of Bnl:GFP concentration outside ( WT area ) to inside ( cytoneme deficient ) of the mutant clones increased significantly compared to the WT control condition ( Figure 4E ) . These results showed that cytonemes are essential for the ASP cells to receive Bnl:GFP from the wing disc source . The distribution profile of Bnl:GFP in btl-LOF clones further suggested that cytonemes are the only major routes for Bnl gradient formation . As illustrated in Figure 4F , F\u2019 , a cytoneme-mediated mechanism of dispersion , which is receptor-dependent , would create cell-autonomous loss of receptor-bound Bnl:GFPex on the surface of a btl-LOF clone . This predicted distribution pattern is different from that of a passive extracellular Bnl:GFP diffusion , which would be expected to result in unperturbed levels of the extracellular EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex on the receptor-LOF clone . Indeed , RNAi-mediated knockdown of btl in clones of ASP cells led to a significant reduction of Bnl:GFPex on the mutant clonal areas compared to the WT neighboring cells ( Figure 4G , G\u2019 ) . Clearly , the distribution pattern of Bnl:GFPex was consistent with a cytoneme-dependent mechanism of gradient formation . Note that an autonomous reduction in intracellular Bnl:GFP ( non-EIF stained ) was also observed in the mutant clones , but such reduction in intracellular Bnl:GFP levels was expected irrespective of the mechanism of signal dispersion , and did not affect our conclusions . Furthermore , in the ASP stalk , where normal levels of Btl are low , generation of btl overexpressing ( btl-GOF , gain of function ) clones induced extension of long polarized cytonemes that projected toward the underlying disc bnl-source . These cytonemes were enriched with EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex on their surfaces ( Figure 4H , H\u2019 ) and the mutant clones had a higher concentration of Bnl:GFPex than their neighbors ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . This result provided direct evidence that the induction of cytonemes in ASP cells increased cell-autonomous contact-dependent Bnl:GFP uptake . How might cytoneme-mediated local signaling in each ASP cell generate a long-range signal gradient across the entire ASP epithelium ? One possibility is that tracheal cells , relative to their distances from the bnl-source , produce different numbers of Bnl-specific cytonemes and\/or establish variable numbers of signaling contacts with the disc bnl-source . To examine this possibility , we live imaged randomly generated CD8:GFP-marked clones in different positions of the ASP and analyzed the orientation and number of cytonemes with different lengths they extend ( Figure 5A\u2013A\u201d ) . In addition , to compare the frequency of signaling contacts among cytonemes emanating from different regions of the ASP , we devised a mosaic analysis method for generation of clonal syb-GRASP . We expressed syb-GFP1-10 in the bnl-source and induced small ( ~1\u20134 cells ) randomly localized CD8:RFP-marked clones across the ASP epithelium that also expressed CD4:GFP11 ( Figure 5D , D\u2019; see Materials and methods ) . In this technique , when cytonemes emanating from the clones in different parts of the ASP established contact with the disc bnl-source , GFP was reconstituted at their contact sites . For assessing the steady-state number of contacts established by different parts of the ASP with the signal source , ASPs containing only 1\u20132 small clones were considered . These experiments showed that the stalk region of a third instar larval ASP , beyond 7 cell-distances along the D-P axis ( ~12 cells long ) from the ASP tip ( Figure 1A\u201d ) , produced only randomly oriented short cytonemes . These cytonemes rarely contacted the bnl-source ( Figures 5A , B , C , D\u2013D\u201d ) . This region also received lower levels of Bnl:GFP ( Figure 1A\u201d , E ) . The number of long polarized cytonemes that oriented toward the bnl-source and established direct contacts with the source increased gradually in the mid ( 4th-7th cells from the ASP tip along the D-P axis ) and the distal tip cells ( 1\u20133 cells from the tip along the D-P axis ) ( Figure 5A\u2019 , A\u201d , B , C , D' , D\"; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013A\u2019\u2019 ) . Thus , long oriented cytonemes that could establish contacts with the Bnl source were produced in a graded fashion across the length of the ASP . A similar gradient in the number of signaling contacts was also observed from cytonemes produced across the vertical axis of the tubular tissue . In a syb-GRASP experiment between the disc and ASP , ASP\u00a0cells in the lower layer that is proximal to the bnl-source had a higher frequency of cytoneme contacts compared to the upper cell layer ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B; Videos 3 , 4 and 5 ) . These results suggested that differential levels of signal uptake through a graded number of cytonemes give rise to the tissue-specific shapes of the Bnl:GFP gradient . How does a steady state pattern of cytonemes across the ASP epithelium develop ? The gradient of numbers of Bnl-receiving cytonemes correlated with the spatial gradient of Bnl ( Figures 5A\u2013B;1E , I; 2D ) . Thus , the zones of variable numbers of ASP cytonemes might reflect differential target gene activities in response to the Bnl gradient . Therefore , we examined the correlation of the Bnl:GFP gradient with the spatial expression domains of several known Bnl target genes , including pntP1 and sprouty ( sty ) ( Hacohen et al . , 1998; Ohshiro et al . , 2002 ) . We also examined expression of the Ets family transcriptional repressor yan , which is suppressed by Ras\/MAPK signaling ( Ohshiro et al . , 2002 ) , and of cut , a homeodomain transcription repressor . Although cut is not known to be a target of Ras\/MAPK signaling , this gene was shown to be expressed in the larval spiracular branch and in the ASP ( Ohshiro et al . , 2002; Pitsouli and Perrimon , 2013; Rao et al . , 2015 ) . The D-P axis of a third instar larval ASP consists of\u00a0~12 cells . We found that ASP cells within a three-cell diameter domain from the distal tip along the D-P axis , which received the highest concentration of Bnl:GFP , expressed sty ( Figure 6A , E; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A;\u00a0Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A , B ) . A broader zone of\u00a0~6\u20137 cell-diameters from the tip along the D-P axis received high-to-moderate levels of Bnl:GFP and induced pntP1 ( Figure 6B , E; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A;\u00a0Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C , D ) . In contrast , the proximal stalk of the ASP from the 7th to 12th cell away from the tip along the D-P axis received negligible levels of Bnl:GFP . In this ASP domain , cut and yan expression gradually increased with increasing distance from the source ( Figure 6C\u2013E; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2E-H ) . Thus , the gradients of cut and yan expression had the exact opposite pattern as the pntP1 and Bnl:GFP gradients . This concentration-dependent activity was also observed across the Z-axis ( Figure 1A\u201d ) . ASP cells in the lower Z-sections that are proximal to the underlying bnl-source expressed higher levels of sty and pntP1 relative to the upper layer cells situated away from the disc source ( Figure 6F; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B , C ) . Thus , across the recipient ASP epithelium , high levels of Bnl:GFP correlated with sty expression , and gradually decreasing levels of Bnl:GFP further away from the source correlated with the expression zones of pntP1 , cut , and yan , respectively ( Figure 6E , F ) . Similar spatial patterning in the gene-expression zones of sty and different ETS family proteins is known to be induced by the vertebrate FGF8 morphogen in mouse neuroectoderm ( Toyoda et al . , 2010 ) . Previously Bnl was considered to be a chemoattractant ( Lebreton and Casanova , 2016; Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter , 2012 ) , which can only elicit a binary signaling response . In contrast , our results suggested that Bnl activated multiple target genes at its various concentrations similar to a morphogen . To further examine whether the target genes were differentially expressed in response to different Bnl concentrations , we overexpressed cDNA-derived Bnl constructs either from the wing disc bnl-source or from small clones of cells within the recipient ASP . Remarkably , even while highly expressed from the wing disc source , Bnl:GFP moved only target-specifically from the disc source to the ASP ( Figure 6H , H\u2019 ) . In comparison to the normal range of endogenous Bnl:GFP distribution and Bnl ( pMAPK ) signaling ( Figure 6G ) , the spatial range of the overexpressed signal and the signaling expanded to all parts of the ASP , including the stalk ( Figure 6H ) . The expanded range of signal led to retraction of the Cut and Yan expressing zone from within the stalk to only the farthest region in the TC , which received little or no Bnl:GFP from the disc source ( Figure 6H\u2013I ) . Moreover , ectopic clones of either Bnl:GFP or Bnl in the ASP stalk non-autonomously induced sty and pntP1 and suppressed cut in the surrounding cells ( Figure 6J , K , L; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . These results showed that Bnl acts as a morphogen to induce concentration-dependent expression of different genes . It was previously reported that PntP1 and Yan antagonize each other\u2019s expression ( Ohshiro et al . , 2002 ) . To examine whether Cut and PntP1 also antagonize each other , we induced ectopic pntP1 and cut mutant clones in the ASP . Reduction of PntP1 levels in the mutant pntP1\u00a0LOF ( pntP1 RNAi ) clones in the ASP tip autonomously upregulated Cut expression within the clones , whereas overexpression of PntP1 in the ectopic pntP1\u00a0GOF clones in the ASP stalk suppressed cut in the mutant cells ( Figure 6M , N ) . On the other hand , ectopic cut GOF clones in the ASP tip suppressed pntP1 and cut LOF clones ( cut RNAi ) in the proximal ASP stalk induced pntP1 within the mutant cells ( Figure 6O , P ) . Thus , PntP1 and Cut reciprocally inhibit each other\u2019s expression . Notably , although PntP1 is a known inducer of btl , pntP1\u00a0GOF\/LOF clones showed only cell-autonomous effects on cut . The btl\u00a0GOF clones in the ASP showed a similar autonomous signaling effect ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . In contrast , each Bnl:GFP GOF clone in the ASP induced non-autonomous effects and organized the surrounding cells to form a new branch ( N\u00a0=\u00a035; Figure 6K , L ) . All these results provided evidence that Bnl acts as a classical morphogen to induce sty at a high level and pntP1 , cut , and yan gradually at lower levels in the ASP ( Figure 6E , F ) . To examine whether the different target genes of Bnl signaling may regulate cytoneme formation , we focused on pntP1 and cut , the two transcription factors that formed counteracting gradients from two opposing poles of the ASP and antagonized each other\u2019s expression ( Figures 6B , C , E , M\u2013P ) . When we induced ectopic cut GOF clones in the distal tip\/mid-ASP regions , the mutant cells produced significantly fewer long and oriented cytonemes compared to the wt clones at an equivalent position ( Figure 7A , A\u2019 versus Figure 5A\u2019\u2019 , C ) . This cytoneme deficiency in the cut\u00a0GOF clones correlated with the autonomous reduction of Bnl:GFP uptake in the mutant clones from the mid\/tip of the ASP ( Figure 7A\u2013B\u2019 ) . On the other hand , the orientation and number of cytonemes from the ASP stalk cells , which generally had high levels of Cut and produced randomly oriented short cytonemes , remained unaffected by cut\u00a0GOF ( Figure 7A\u2019 ) . Thus , high levels of Cut negatively regulate the formation of cytonemes that orient specifically toward the bnl-source . In addition to this finding , Cut was also known to be a suppressor of btl in the larval spiracular branch ( Pitsouli and Perrimon , 2013 ) . Therefore , high levels of Cut elicit negative feedback on Bnl signaling by suppressing both the Bnl-receiving cytonemes and Btl synthesis ( Figure 8A , A\u2019 ) . A similar inhibitory effect on cytonemes was observed for Yan , which was a known antagonist for PntP1 and embryonic tracheal filopodia formation ( Okenve-Ramos and Llimargas , 2014 ) ( Figure 7\u2014supplement figure 1A-B\u2019; Figure 8A\u2019 ) . Collectively , these results showed that cut and yan , the two genes that are expressed in the ASP stalk in response to lower Bnl levels , suppress cytoneme-formation and Btl expression . Generally , high-to-mid levels of Bnl signaling induced pntP1 in the distal tip-mid ASP region ( Figure 6B , E ) . When ectopic pntP1\u00a0GOF clones were generated in the ASP stalk , the mutant cells extended significantly more long ( >30 \u03bcm ) cytonemes oriented toward the underlying disc bnl-source than the WT clones ( Figure 7C , C\u2019 , compared to Figure 5A , C ) . In contrast , pntP1-LOF clones at the ASP tip extended a significantly fewer number of long oriented cytonemes from the tip cells than the WT clones ( Figure 7D , D\u2019 , compared to Figure 5A\u2019\u2019 , C ) . Loss of cytonemes in the pntP1\u00a0LOF clones correlated with the suppression of Bnl:GFP uptake in the mutant ASP cells , and an increase in the number of cytonemes in the pntP1\u00a0GOF cells increased the levels of Bnl:GFP in them ( Figure 7E\u2013H ) . An \u03b1GFP EIF assay revealed that the long cytonemes projecting from the pntP1\u00a0GOF clones in the ASP stalk were enriched in EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex , suggesting that the cells received signal by extending cytonemes ( Figure 7G , H ) . In addition , PntP1 was known to induce btl transcription in embryonic trachea ( Ohshiro et al . , 2002 ) . When we generated small ( 1\u20134 cells ) pntP1\u00a0GOF clones in the stalk of the ASP in btl:cherryendo larvae , the PntP1 overexpression increased the levels of Btl:Cherry in the clones . Strikingly , the newly synthesized Btl:Cherry molecules also formed local concentration gradients within each of the pntP1\u00a0GOF clones ( Figure 7I ) . These results showed that PntP1 elicits positive-feedback on Btl synthesis and Bnl-receiving cytoneme production ( Figure 8A\u2019 ) . Interestingly , PntP1 and Cut ( Figure 6M\u2013P ) or PntP1 and Yan ( Ohshiro et al . , 2002 ) can reciprocally inhibit each other\u2019s expression . Therefore , a ratio of the levels of PntP1 to Cut or to Yan could determine the number of cytonemes and Btl receptors in a cell . Based on our results , we propose that the counteracting activities of PntP1 and Cut\/Yan and their expression from two opposite poles in response to the high-to-low Bnl levels in the ASP establish a steady-state gradient of numbers of Btl-containing cytonemes . Signaling through these cytonemes would self-generate the shape of a robust signal and signaling gradient ( Figure 8A\u2019 ) . \n Prior to this study , branching morphogenesis of tissues such as vertebrate lung or vasculature was proposed to be induced by exogenous , diffusible signal gradients . For instance , a mesenchymal FGF10 gradient induces branching in the vertebrate lung , and a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\/VEGF gradient induces vascular sprouting ( Affolter et al . , 2009; Spurlin and Nelson , 2017 ) . Although the paracrine functions of these signals were well characterized , our demonstration and detailed characterization of the Bnl gradient represents the first example of an inductive gradient for branching morphogenesis . In contrast to the traditional idea of a preexisting diffusible gradient , we showed that the shapes of the inductive Bnl gradient are dynamic , adaptable , and form only in a receptor-bound state within the recipient tissue . Moreover , we showed that the Bnl gradient self-generates its variable recipient branch-specific shapes by regulating its cytoneme-mediated transport . Self-generation of tissue-specific gradients may be a common and essential strategy for sustaining the robust , yet variable gradient shapes in dynamically migrating tissues . Consistent with this view , the chemokine Cxcl12a also forms a self-generating gradient to regulate dynamic migration of the Zebrafish lateral line ( Don\u00e0 et al . , 2013 ) . Notably , inductive signals such as Bnl or VEGF were previously thought to induce chemotactic migration by inducing binary signaling responses in the recipient cells ( Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter , 2012 ) . Therefore , identification of an organizer-like morphogenetic role of Bnl brings a critical shift to our understanding of branching morphogenesis . Several earlier reports , including biophysical analyses of vertebrate FGF8 and its distribution patterns in tissues , proposed a free or restricted diffusion-based dispersion mechanism for gradient formation ( B\u00f6kel and Brand , 2013; Toyoda et al . , 2010; Yu et al . , 2009 ) . An alternative model proposed that the FGF8 morphogen gradient is also\u00a0formed by gradual decay of fgf8 mRNA and its translation in a growing vertebrate embryo ( Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9 , 2004 ) . In contrast , all of our genetic analyses and direct imaging results show that the Bnl gradient is formed by cytoneme-mediated direct transport . An earlier study showed that ASP cells project Btl-containing cytonemes to establish contact with the disc Bnl source , and fail to induce pMAPK signaling without these cytoneme-mediated contacts ( Roy et al . , 2014 ) . In this study we extended those initial findings . By generating endo-tagged Bnl:GFP and Btl:Cherry constructs expressed at physiological levels , utilizing an EIF assay to detect externalized Bnl molecules , and by applying high resolution visualization techniques , we obtained reliable and unbiased evidence for Bnl dispersion via cytonemes . We showed that ASP cytonemes receive Bnl molecules by establishing direct membrane synapses with the signal producing cells . Super-resolution imaging of membrane-marked ASP and source cells documented these synaptic sites and showed a selective enrichment of externalized Bnl molecules only at these signaling contacts ( Figure 3J ) . At this point , we do not know why and how Bnl is released from producing cells only at cytoneme-source membrane contact sites . Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process is an important new direction for future investigations . Antibody-based EIF analysis under detergent-free conditions and super-resolution imaging of endogenously expressed Bnl:GFP showed that at a steady state , a high concentration of the signal moves along the surface of the cytonemes in receptor-bound forms ( Figure 3C\u2013H ) . It is likely that receptor-bound Bnl ligands move along the surface of the cytonemes by an energy-dependent motor transport and are endocytosed when they reach the ASP cell body . Super-resolution imaging also revealed a previously uncharacterized sub-resolution distribution of Bnl:GFP nanopuncta ( Figure 3F\u2013F\u2019\u2019; Figure 3\u2014supplement figure 2 ) , suggesting the existence of novel cellular and molecular events that regulate the cytoneme-mediated signaling process . Each of these individual cellular and molecular mechanisms would influence the levels of Bnl signaling in a cell and thereby would contribute to the essential feedback mechanisms by which the cytoneme and the morphogen gradients are formed . Contact-dependent Bnl exchange implies that the ASP cells can interpret the direction from where ( and from whom ) they receive the Bnl signal , in addition to its levels . We\u00a0do not know how ASP cytonemes find the bnl-source and establish the signaling contacts . A recent study had shown an important regulatory role of the components of the extracellular matrix , which interact with the signal-specific cytonemes and stabilize their directionality ( Huang and Kornberg , 2016 ) . Another possible mechanism could be that the cells in the disc Bnl source extend Bnl-containing cytonemes to establish an initial contact with the recipient cytonemes to provide them the necessary pathfinding information . In fact , Hh is known to be delivered by the source cytonemes to the recipient cytonemes in Drosophila wing disc and vertebrate limb buds ( Chen et al . , 2017; Gonz\u00e1lez-M\u00e9ndez et al . , 2017; Sanders et al . , 2013 ) . However , the imaging conditions used\u00a0in this study could not detect Bnl-containing source cytonemes . Future live imaging analyses are required to elucidate the mechanisms of cytoneme pathfinding . How morphogen gradients are produced in tissues is a long-standing central question . Based on our experimental results , we propose a model for the mechanism by which cytonemes can create and maintain a morphogen gradient ( Figure 8A\u2019 ) . We uncovered that ASP epithelial cells extend a graded number of cytonemes that reach out and contact the disc bnl source to receive the signal ( Figure 5A\u2013D\u2019\u2019 ) . Recipient cells close to the source have many long polarized cytonemes , but their numbers gradually reduced as the distance from the source increases . Clonal GFP-reconstitution analyses suggested that the number of cytoneme-contacts an ASP cell makes is inversely proportional to its distance from the signal source ( Figure 5D\u2013D\u201d ) . Since reception of Bnl is contact-dependent ( Figure 3I , I\u2019 ) , these features of patterned cytoneme formation in the recipient ASP explain how cytoneme-mediated signal reception can generate the recipient tissue-specific shapes of the gradient . These observations led us to address a very important question: how are the cytoneme patterns developed and maintained in the tissue ? Answering this question was expected to provide the basis by which cytonemes create and regulate gradient shapes and tissue patterns . A key finding providing insight into this question came from our analysis of the spatial domains of targets of Bnl signaling in the ASP . One of the target genes , pntP1 , is induced by high Bnl levels in the distal region of the ASP and positively regulates the formation of cytonemes and Btl synthesis ( Figure 6B , E ) . On the other hand , surprisingly , the target gene cut , which is induced by gradually lower levels of Bnl in the ASP stalk region away from the source , negatively controls cytoneme formation ( Figure 6C , E; 7A , A\u2019; 8A' ) and Btl synthesis ( Pitsouli and Perrimon , 2013 ) . Moreover , the transcription factors Cut and PntP1 feedback-inhibit each other\u2019s expression to maintain their zones of expression in response to Bnl levels ( Figure 6M\u2013P ) . The consequence is a regulatory loop that controls the generation and reinforcement of different numbers of cytonemes and levels of Bnl signaling , making the contours of the Bnl gradient robust , precisely tissue-specific , and self-sustaining . The roles of these target genes might also explain how variable shapes of Bnl gradients are sculpted in coordination with the growth and development of recipient tissues . One current morphogen model proposes that the signal gradients are generated and scaled to the size of the recipient tissue by the ratio of two diffusible molecules , a morphogen and a contractor\/expander , which emanate from opposite poles of the tissue and elicit non-autonomous global feedback to control each other\u2019s distribution ( Barkai and Shilo , 2009; Ben-Zvi et al . , 2011; Restrepo and Basler , 2011; Shilo and Barkai , 2017 ) . Although Cut and PntP1 are intracellular transcription factors that function cell autonomously , their counteracting feedback activities , regulating where and when signal-specific cytonemes are made as a function of the levels of signal received , can self-generate gradients adopting any recipient-specific shape ( Figures 1F;\u00a08A' ) . This mechanism implies an interesting systemic feedback where the gradient shape is a result of the growth and patterning of the recipient tissue , which it controls . However , this mechanism also implies that to initiate such a self-sustaining gradient , initial physical contact of a part of the recipient epithelium with the signal source is required . In fact , each tracheal cell is capable of inducing either PntP1 or Cut\/Yan expression irrespective of its position within the recipient epithelium ( Figure 8A ) . Thus , an ectopic new bnl source near a pre-existing tracheal branch can initiate a local gradient of cytoneme contacts leading to polarized signal and signaling gradient formation as well as neo-branch organization ( Figure 8B ) . In agreement with this view , spatiotemporal expression of Bnl surrounding the embryonic tracheal placode is known to induce new branches ( Sutherland et al . , 1996 ) . Moreover , if the Bnl response genes are not the same or are not regulated in the same manner at all sites and at all times , different patterns of cytoneme formation can be generated leading to changes in spatial patterns of signal distribution and tissue morphology . Given the commonality of fundamental signaling events mediated by conserved signaling proteins , feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport may offer an explanation for why signal gradients are so precise , yet adaptable and for how diverse tissue morphologies can result from just one signal transduction pathway . \n The bnl:gfpendo and btl:cherryendo alleles were generated following CRISPR\/Cas9 based genome editing method described earlier ( Du et al . , 2017 ) ( Figures 1B and 2A; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C ) . The bnl:gfpendo knock-in allele expressed a chimeric Bnl:GFP protein containing a superfolder-GFP ( sfGFP ) fused in-frame at\u00a0~53 amino acid downstream to the conserved FGF domain ( 247 to 376 amino-acid ) ( Figure 1B ) . Due to its high solubility and efficient folding kinetics in extracellular environment ( P\u00e9delacq et al . , 2006 ) , we selected sfGFP for tagging Bnl . The btl:cherryendo knock-in allele expressed Btl:Cherry containing in-frame C-terminal fusion of mCherry ( Figure 2A ) . Multiple gRNA binding sites with variable efficiency were selected for independent parallel genome-editing experiments to achieve the highest probability of obtaining the intended chimeras and identify the most consistent patterns of Bnl:GFP and Btl:Cherry distribution in tissues among various lines . The gRNA expression constructs were cloned by ligating the annealed complementary oligos ( Key resources table ) as described in ( Du et al . , 2017 ) . The gRNAs ( PAM sequence underlined ) used for generating bnl:gfpendo and btl:cherryendo were: BnlGFP_gRNA-1: GGGCCAATCGCGTCAAGCACGG BnlGFP_gRNA-2: ATATTAGCAGTAGCCTTAGCGG BnlGFP_gRNA-3: CATCACGGAGACGGTGCCGCAGG BtlCherry_gRNA-1: AGGTGTACTGATATCTAAGCGG BtlCherry_gRNA-2: CGGCATCGAAAGGTCCAGATAGG Replacement donors , pDonor-bnl:GFP , and pDonor-btl:Cherry were designed and generated following ( Du et al . , 2017 ) . For efficient \u2018Homology-Directed Repair\u2019 ( HDR ) , these constructs contained the tag sequence flanked by\u00a0~1 . 5 to 1 . 7 kb long gene-specific 5\u2019- and 3\u2019- homology arms ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A; Key resources table ) . Both 5\u2019- and 3\u2019- homology arms were PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA from nos-cas9 parent fly , sequence verified , and were fused together with the sfgfp or mCherry sequence by overlap extension PCR . To avoid retargeting of the gRNA to the engineered locus , synonymous mutations were introduced into or near the PAM sequence of the homology arms via the primers used for their amplification ( Key resources table ) . The clones were fully sequenced before being used for genomic replacement . Transgenic flies harboring gRNA vectors at the attP40 landing site ( y1 v1 nos-phiC31; attP40 host ) were generated following ( Kondo and Ueda , 2013 ) . Males harboring a specific U6:3-gRNA were crossed to nos-Cas9 ( nos-Cas9 ZH2A , BL# 54591 ) females to obtain nos-cas9\/+; U6:3-gRNA\/+embryos . For each genome-editing experiment , the corresponding replacement donor plasmid was injected into the germline of these embryos . A step-wise crossing strategy , as described earlier ( Du et al . , 2017 ) , was followed to obtain the G0-F2 progenies and establish individual fly lines for screening . The correct \u2018ends-out\u2019 HDR was screened by a PCR based strategy ( Du et al . , 2017 ) , followed by the analyses of tissue-specific expression patterns of the tagged-genes under a confocal microscope ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C ) . Amplification products obtained using PCR primers fwd1-rev2 and fwd2-rev1 confirmed knock-in positive lines , whereas amplification by the M13F and rev3 primers indicated unintended \u2018ends-in\u2019 HDR . Finally , a correct sized PCR product obtained using primers fwd1-rev1 confirmed the ends-out HDR ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B\u2019\u2019\u2019; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . All GFP or mCherry positive , sequence verified lines were outcrossed to remove unintended mutations ( if any ) , and any putative non-specific off-target sites were further sequence confirmed to be free of genome-editing . The homozygous btl:cherryendo , and bnl:gfpendo fly lines with accurate genomic sequences had a normal tissue morphology , and expected expression\/distribution patterns ( Figure 1C\u2013D\u2019 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C; Figure 2B; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . We used one BnlGFP_gRNA-3 ( c26-9 ) , and a Btl:Cherry_gRNA-1 ( a21-10 ) line for all analyses . For secGFP , the N-terminal 32 amino-acid ( 96 nucleotides ) long signal peptide sequence of Bnl was cloned in-frame upstream of a sfgfp sequence into pUC19 using Gibson Assembly ( Key resources table ) . The product was sub-cloned into the BglII , Acc651 sites of the pUAST for P-element mediated germline transformation in Drosophila . A transgenic fly was generated that harbored an overexpression UAS-Bnl:GFP construct derived from bnl cDNA ( DGRC ) . All crosses were incubated at 25\u00b0C unless specified otherwise . For nsybGRASP labeling of cytoneme contacts ( Figure 3I , I\u2019; Videos 3 and 5 ) : btl-Gal4 , UAS-CD8:Cherry; bnl-LexA\/TM6 virgin females were crossed to lexO-nsyb:GFP1-10 , UAS-CD4:GFP11 males . Flip-out clones of specific genotype were generated by 8\u201315 min 37\u00b0C heat shock of the early 3rd instar larvae followed by 25\u00b0C incubation until they reached the\u00a0late\u00a03rd instar stages ( ~24 hr ) . A standard immunostaining protocol was used following ( Du et al . , 2017; Roy et al . , 2014 ) . To detect the surface exposed\/localized Bnl:GFPex or Bnlex , standard detergent-free live immunostaining protocol ( EIF ) was used following ( Schwank et al . , 2011; Strigini and Cohen , 2000 ) , except the live tissues were incubated with \u03b1Bnl or \u03b1GFP antibody in optimized WM1 medium ( Du et al . , 2017 ) . Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:1000 from Molecular Probes ) were used for immunofluorescence detection . Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Bnl antibody was generated from YenZym Antibodies , LLC against a peptide containing amino acid residues from 699 to 717 region of the Bnl protein . For live imaging , wing imaginal discs and their associated trachea were prepared following ( Roy et al . , 2014 ) . The imaging systems used in this study included Leica SP5X confocal microscope equipped with an ultrasensitive Hybrid Detector , an Andor spinning disc confocal equipped with iXon 897 EMCCD camera , Perkin Elmer UltraVIEW Vox with an EMCCD camera , and a ZeissLSM 800 with Airyscan . Super-resolution images of the Airyscan detector resolved poorly fluorescent and densely populated Bnl:GFP nano-puncta on the ASP\/disc cell surface ( Figure 3F\u2013F\u2019\u2019; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The images were processed and analyzed with Fiji . For 3D-rendering , Andor iQ3 software was used . To visualize the faint signals , brightness\/intensities of the images were digitally increased following ( Roy et al . , 2014; Roy et al . , 2011b ) . For most images , maximum intensity projections of at least 30 optical sections were shown . The Intensity profiles of Bnl:GFP , Btl:Cherry , pntP1 , cut , sty and yan gradients were derived from the maximum intensity projections along the D-P axis of the ASPs . For Figure 1I\u2013I\u2019\u2019 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E\u201d , the intensity profiles were derived across the entire digitally straightened epithelium following ( Long et al . , 2009 ) . A\u00a0~\u00a040 pixels wide line was fitted following the curved tracheal\/ASP epithelium . For quantification of Bnl:GFP and Bnl:GFPex uptake in mutant clones , total GFP or EIF ( red , anti-GFP ) intensities were measured from selected areas in mutant clones and neighboring wt cells and normalized with the selected area ( Figure 4; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1; Figure 7B , B\u2019 , E\u2013H ) . For Figure 5A\u2013C , Figure 7A , A\u2019 , C\u2013D\u2019 , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 , cytonemes were manually counted and were grouped by length ( <15 \u03bcm , 15\u201330 \u03bcm , and\u00a0>30 \u03bcm ) as reported in ( Roy et al . , 2011b ) . Cytonemes emanating from each clone were captured over\u00a0~30\u201340 \u03bcm Z-sections with 0 . 35 \u03bcm step size . The R program was used to generate R plots from at least five preparations of each genotype to analyze cytoneme orientation and number . Statistical significance was determined with a two-tailed t-test ( Figure 3I'; 4E , G\u2019; 7B\u2019 , E\u2019 ) , or a one-way ANOVA ( Figure 5B , D\u2019\u2019 ) followed by Tukey honestly significant different ( HSD ) test . For all the numerical data analyses , the amount of variation from the mean is indicated by the standard deviation .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["developmental biology"],"id":"elife-38137-v3"}
{"lay_summary":"Our genomes contain a record of historical events . This is because when groups of people are separated for generations , the DNA sequence in the two groups\u2019 genomes will change in different ways . Looking at the differences in the genomes of people from the same population can help researchers to understand and reconstruct the historical interactions that brought their ancestors together . The mixing of two populations that were previously separate is known as admixture . Africa as a continent has few written records of its history . This means that it is somewhat unknown which important movements of people in the past generated the populations found in modern-day Africa . Busby et al . have now attempted to use DNA to look into this and reconstruct the last 4000 years of genetic history in African populations . As has been shown in other regions of the world , the new analysis showed that all African populations are the result of historical admixture events . However , Busby et al . could characterize these events to unprecedented level of detail . For example , multiple ethnic groups from The Gambia and Mali all show signs of sharing the same set of ancestors from West Africa , Europe and Asia who mixed around 2000 years ago . Evidence of a migration of people from Central West Africa , known as the Bantu expansion , could also be detected , and was shown to carry genes to the south and east . An important next step will be to now look at the consequences of the observed gene-flow , and ask if it has contributed to spreading beneficial , or detrimental , mutations around Africa .","article":"Similarity between two individuals in the combination of genetic markers along their chromosomes indicates shared ancestry and can be used to identify historical connections between different population groups due to admixture . We use a genome-wide , haplotype-based , analysis to characterise the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups . We show that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years , and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions . In fact , most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years . Our in-depth analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments , both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology . \n Advances in DNA analysis technology and the drive to understand the genetic basis of human phenotypes has led to a rapid growth in the amount of genomic data that is available for analysis . Whilst tens of thousands of genetic variants have been associated with different diseases in populations of European descent ( Welter et al . , 2014 ) , less progress has been made in studies of important diseases in Africa ( Need and Goldstein , 2009 ) . Several consortia are beginning to focus on understanding the genetic basis of infectious and non-communicable disease specifically in Africa ( Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network , 2008; 2015; H3Africa Consortium , 2014; Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) , and a number of recent studies have described patterns of genetic variation across the continent ( Campbell and Tishkoff , 2008; Tishkoff et al . , 2009; Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . Analyses of the structure of genetic variation are important in the design , analysis , and interpretation of genetic epidemiology studies \u2013 which aim to uncover novel relationships between genes , the environment , and disease ( Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network , 2015 ) \u2013 and provide an opportunity to relate patterns of association to historical connections between different human populations . Admixture occurs when genetically differentiated ancestral groups come together and mix , a process which is increasingly regarded as a common feature of human populations across the globe ( Patterson et al . , 2012; Hellenthal et al . , 2014; Busby et al . , 2015 ) . Genome-wide analyses of African populations are refining previous models of the continent\u2019s history and its impact on genetic diversity . One insight is the identification of clear , but complex , evidence for the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent as a result of admixture over a variety of timescales ( Pagani et al . , 2012; Pickrell et al . , 2014; Gurdasani et al . , 2014; Hodgson et al . , 2014a; Llorente et al . , 2015 ) . On a broad sample of 18 ethnic groups from eight countries , the African Genome Variation Project ( AGVP ) ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) recreated a previous analysis to identify recent Eurasian admixture , within the last 1 . 5 thousand years ( ky ) , in the Fulani of West Africa ( Tishkoff et al . , 2009; Henn et al . , 2012 ) and several East African groups from Kenya; older Eurasian ancestry ( 2\u20135 ky ) in Ethiopian groups , consistent with previous studies of similar populations ( Pagani et al . , 2012; Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) ; and a novel signal of ancient ( >7 . 5 ky ) Eurasian admixture in the Yoruba of Central West Africa ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . Comparisons of contemporary sub-Saharan African populations with the first ancient genome from within Africa , a 4 . 5 ky Ethiopian individual ( Llorente et al . , 2015 ) , provide additional support for limited migration of Eurasian ancestry back into East Africa within the last 3000 years . Within this timescale , the major demographic change within Africa was the transition from hunting and gathering to pastoralist and agricultural lifestyles ( Diamond and Bellwood , 2003; Smith , 2005; Barham and Mitchell , 2008; Li et al . , 2014 ) . This shift was long and complex and occurred at different speeds , instigating contrasting interactions between the agriculturalist pioneers and the inhabitant people ( Mitchell , 2002; Marks et al . , 2014 ) . The change was initialised by the spread of pastoralism ( i . e . the raising and herding of livestock ) across Africa and the subsequent movement east and south from Central West Africa of agricultural technology together with the branch of Niger-Congo languages known as Bantu ( Mitchell , 2002; Barham and Mitchell , 2008 ) . The extent to which this cultural expansion was accompanied by people is an active research question , but an increasing number of molecular studies indicate that the expansion of languages was accompanied by the diffusion of people ( Beleza et al . , 2005; Berniell-Lee et al . , 2009; Tishkoff et al . , 2009; Pakendorf et al . , 2011; de Filippo et al . , 2012; Ansari Pour et al . , 2013; Li et al . , 2014; Gonz\u00e1lez-Santos et al . , 2015 ) . The AGVP also found evidence of widespread hunter-gatherer ancestry in African populations , including ancient ( 9 ky ) Khoesan ancestry in the Igbo from Nigeria , and more recent hunter-gatherer ancestry in eastern ( 2 . 5\u20134 . 5 ky ) and southern ( 0 . 9\u20134 ky ) African populations ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . The identification of hunter-gatherer ancestry in non-hunter-gatherer populations together with the timing of these latter events is consistent with the known expansion of Bantu languages across Africa within the last 3 ky ( Mitchell , 2002; Diamond and Bellwood , 2003; Smith , 2005; Barham and Mitchell , 2008; Marks et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2014 ) . These studies have described the novel and important influence of both Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on the population genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa and provide an important description of the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within the continent , but questions remain of the extent and timing of key events , and their impact on contemporary populations . Here we analyse genome-wide data from 12 Eurasian and 46 sub-Saharan African groups . Half ( 23 ) of the African groups represent subsets of samples collected from nine countries as part of the MalariaGEN consortium . Details on the recruitment of samples in relation to studying malaria genetics are published elsewhere ( Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network , 2014; 2015 ) . The remaining 23 groups are from publicly available datasets from a further eight sub-Saharan African countries ( Pagani et al . , 2012; Schlebusch et al . , 2012; Petersen et al . , 2013 ) and the 1000 Genomes Project ( 1KGP ) , with Eurasian groups from the latter included to help understand the genetic contribution from outside of the continent ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . With the exception of Austronesian in Madagascar , African languages can be broadly classified into four major macro-families: Afroasiatic , Nilo-Saharan , Niger-Congo , and Khoesan ( Blench , 2006 ) ; and although we have representative groups from each ( Supplementary file 1 ) , our sample represents a significant proportion of the sub-Saharan population in terms of number , but not does not equate to a complete picture of African ethnic diversity . We created an integrated dataset of genotypes at 328 , 000 high-quality SNPs and use established approaches for comparing population allele frequencies across groups to provide a baseline view of historical gene-flow . We then apply statistical approaches to phasing genotypes to obtain haplotypes for each individual , and use previously published methods to represent the haplotypes that an individual carries as a mosaic of other haplotypes in the sample ( so-called chromosome painting [Li and Stephens , 2003] ) . We present a detailed picture of haplotype sharing across sub-Saharan Africa using a model-based clustering approach that groups individuals using haplotype information alone . The inferred groups reflect broad-scale geographic patterns . At finer scales , our analysis reveals smaller groups , and often differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry ( Tishkoff et al . , 2009; Bryc et al . , 2010; Hodgson et al . , 2014a ) . We describe these patterns by measuring gene-flow between populations and relate them to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa . Understanding the extent to which individuals share haplotypes ( which we call coancestry ) , rather than independent markers , can provide a rich description of ancestral relationships and population history ( Lawson et al . , 2012; Leslie et al . , 2015 ) . For each group we use the latest analytical tools to characterise the populations as mixtures of haplotypes and provide estimates for the date of admixture events ( Lawson et al . , 2012; Hellenthal et al . , 2014; Leslie et al . , 2015; Montinaro et al . , 2015 ) . As well as providing a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups , we identify the dominant events which have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa . We close by discussing the relevance of these observations to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa . \n Throughout this article we use shorthand current-day geographical and ethno-linguistic labels to describe ancestry . For example we write \u201cEurasian ancestry in East African Niger-Congo speakers\u201d , where the more precise definition would be \u201cancestry originating from groups currently living in Eurasia in groups currently living in East Africa that speak Niger-Congo languages\u201d ( Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) . We also stress that the use of Khoesan in the current setting refers to groups with shared linguistic characteristics which does not necessarily imply shared close genealogical relationships ( G\u00fcldemann and Fehn , 2014 ) . Our combined dataset included 3283 individuals from 46 sub-Saharan different African ethnic groups and 12 non-African populations ( Figure 1A and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . An initial fineSTRUCTURE analysis ( outlined below and in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) demonstrated sub-structure in two of the African ethnic groups , the Fula and Mandinka , so we split both of these populations into two groups , giving a final set of 48 African groups for all analyses . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 003Figure 1 .

Clades containing outlying individuals from the Fula and Mandinka are also shown . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 007 As an initial description of the genetic structure of the samples we applied principal component analysis to the genotype data ( Patterson et al . , 2006 ) . As in other regions of the world ( Novembre et al . , 2008; Behar et al . , 2010 ) , the leading principal components show that genetic relationships are broadly defined by geographical and ethno-linguistic similarity ( Figure 1B , C ) . The first two principal components ( PCs ) reflect ethno-linguistic divides: PC1 splits southern Khoesan speaking populations from the rest of Africa , and PC2 splits the East African Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan speakers from sub-Saharan African Niger-Congo speakers . The third axis of variation defines east versus west Africa , suggesting that in general , population structure in Africa largely mirrors linguistic and geographic similarity ( Tishkoff et al . , 2009 ) . To access the information from the combination of markers along chromosomes we phased the genotype data into haplotypes , and applied a previously published implementation of chromosome painting ( CHROMOPAINTER [Lawson et al . , 2012] ) , to estimate the amount of an individual\u2019s genome that is shared with each other individual in the data . More specifically , we paint each recipient individual\u2019s genome as a mosaic of haplotype segments ( chunks ) copied from each other donor individual , and summarise these as copying vectors . We used the clustering algorithm implemented in fineSTRUCTURE ( Lawson et al . , 2012 ) to group individuals purely on the similarity of these copying vectors ( Figure 1 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The pairwise coancestry between individuals can be visualised as a heatmap with each row being the copying vector for each sample ( Figure 1D ) , and these are clustered hierarchically to form a tree which describes the inferred relationship between different groups ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The fineSTRUCTURE analysis identified 154 clusters of individuals , grouped on the basis of copying vector similarity ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Some ethnic groups , such as the Yoruba , Mossi , Jola and Ju\/\u2019hoansi form clusters containing only individuals from their own ethnic group . In other populations , most notably from The\u00a0Gambia and Kenya , individuals from several different ethnic groups cluster together . These are the two countries where the most ethnic groups were sampled , seven and four respectively , and differential sampling could partly explain this observation . Consistent with PCA , the fineSTRUCTURE analysis indicates that African populations tend to share more DNA with geographically proximate populations ( dark colours on the diagonal; Figure 1D ) . Block-like structures on the diagonal indicate higher levels of haplotype sharing , as measured by the number of chunks copied , within groups . These patterns are strongest in a subset of the Khoesan speaking individuals ( eg . the Ju\/\u2019hoansi ) , several groups from the East Africa ( Sudanese , Ari , and Somali groups ) , and the Fulani and Jola from The\u00a0Gambia . Using the results of the PCA and fineSTRUCTURE analyses together with ethno-linguistic classifications and geography , we defined seven groups of populations within Africa ( Supplementary file 1 ) , which we refer to as ancestry regions ( shown on the left of Figure 1D ) when describing gene-flow across Africa . From this perspective , the heatmap also shows evidence for coancestry across the continent ( more chunks copied away from the diagonal ) , which is indicative of historical connections between modern-day groups . For example , east Africans from Kenya , Malawi and Tanzania tend to share more DNA with west Africans ( lower right ) than vice versa ( upper left ) , which suggests that more haplotypes may have spread from west to east Africa . These patterns of coancestry provide evidence of widespread sharing of haplotypes within and between ancestry regions . To quantify population structure , we used two metrics to measure the difference between each of the 48 African and 12 Eurasian groups . First , we used the classical measure FST ( Hudson et al . , 1992; Bhatia et al . , 2013 ) which measures the differentiation in SNP allele frequencies between two groups . The second metric uses the difference in copying vectors between two groups to estimate the total variation distance ( TVD ) ( Leslie et al . , 2015 ) at the haplotypic level which provides an alternative measure of differentiation based on combinations of alleles at SNPs along chromosomes . Figure 2A shows these two metrics side by side in the upper and lower diagonal . When compared to the level of differentiation between Eurasian and African populations , FST measured at our integrated set of SNPs is relatively low between many groups from West , Central , and East Africa ( yellows on the upper right triangle ) . In contrast , TVD between the same populations highlights haplotypic differences within Africa which are as strong as between Europe and Asia ( pink and purples in lower left triangle ) . Whilst pairwise TVD tends to increase with pairwise FST the relationship is neither perfect ( Pearson\u2019s correlation R2 = 0 . 79 ) nor\u00a0linear ( Figure 2B ) . For example , the Chonyi from Kenya have relatively low FST but high TVD with West African groups , like the Jola ( Chonyi-Jola FST = 0 . 019; Chonyi-Jola TVD = 0 . 803 ) showing that , whilst allele frequency differences between the two populations are relatively low , when we compare the populations\u2019 copying vectors , the haplotypic differences are some of the strongest between sub-Saharan groups . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 008Figure 2 . Haplotypes capture more population structure than independent loci . ( A ) For each population pair , we estimated pairwise FS\u2062T ( upper right triangle ) using 328 , 000 independent SNPs , and T\u2062V\u2062D ( lower left triangle ) using population averaged copying vectors from CHROMOPAINTER . T\u2062V\u2062D measures the difference between two copying vectors . ( B ) Comparison of pairwise FS\u2062T and T\u2062V\u2062D shows that they are not linearly related: some population pairs have low FS\u2062T and high T\u2062V\u2062D .

Haplotypic analysis of populations from the Central West Africa ancestry region accesses fine-scale population differentiation . Here we show a comparison of principal components analysis ( PCA ) , which uses genotype data , with fineSTRUCTURE , which uses haplotypic information in the form of painted chromosomes . The five plots in the top panel show the results of the main PCA based on genotype data . Symbols represent individuals and are detailed in the legend . PC3 differentiates the Yoruba from other groups in the region , but individuals from Central West Africa overlap at the remaining PCs , suggesting close genealogical relationships between individuals . The lower panel shows the results of the chromosome painting analysis , which we used with fineSTRUCTURE , where all individuals were allowed to copy from all other individuals . The rows of the heatmap represent un-normalised , individual copying vectors , with the mean number of chunks copied from each donor region as columns . Subtle differences in the copying of individuals from each of the five Central West African groups can be seen , which fineSTRUCTURE uses to cluster individuals into four clusters . We show a close-up of the fineSTRUCTURE tree from Figure 1 on the right of the bottom panel . Each group separates into its own cluster , with the exception of two of the groups from Ghana , the Kasem and Namkam , which are put in the same fineSTRUCTURE cluster . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 013 In Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 we show a comparison of PCA , based on genotype data , and fineSTRUCTURE , which uses haplotypes , from a subset of individuals from the Central West African Niger-Congo ancestry region ( from Nigeria , Ghana , and Burkina Faso ) . Whilst we observe some , limited , population structure with PCA , when we look at the copying vectors , we can see the subtle differences in copying that cause fineSTRUCTURE to separate the five ethnic groups into clusters containing only other individuals from their own ethnic group of individuals . The exception to this are the Namkam and Kasem , who are very genetically similar ( pairwise FST of < 0 . 001 ) and are merged into a single group . So , consistent with results in European populations ( Leslie et al . , 2015; Busby et al . , 2015 ) , chromosome painting analyses of African groups can reveal subtle population structure that is hard to detect using approaches based on genotypes alone ( for example PCA and FST ) . Taken together , these observations motivate using haplotype-based approaches to characterise population relationships , in addition to those which consider allele frequencies on their own . As argued above , a full analysis of admixture best leverages haplotype structure , and we return to this below . To gain an initial understanding of admixture , we applied previously published approaches which analyse the correlations in allele frequencies within and between populations ( Pickrell et al . , 2014; Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . The first approach , the three-population test ( f3 statistic [Reich et al . , 2009] ) , estimates the proportion of shared genetic drift between a target population and two potential source populations to identify significant departures from the null model of no admixture . Negative values are indicative of canonical admixture events where the allele frequencies in the target population are intermediate between the two source populations . Consistent with recent research ( Pickrell et al . , 2014; Pickrell and Reich , 2014; Gurdasani et al . , 2014; Llorente et al . , 2015 ) , the majority ( 83% , 40\/48 ) , but not all , of the African groups surveyed showed evidence of admixture ( f3<-5 ) . ( Supplementary file 2 ) . We do not infer admixture using this statistic in the Jola , Mossi , Kasem , Namkam , Yoruba , Sudanese , Gumuz , and Ju\/\u2019hoansi . In most other groups the most significant f3 statistic includes either the Ju\/\u2019hoansi or a 1KGP European source ( GBR , CEU , FIN , or TSI ) . Niger-Congo speaking groups from Central West and Southern Africa tend to show most significant statistics involving the Ju\/\u2019hoansi , whereas West and East African and Southern Khoesan speaking groups tended to show most significant statistics involving European sources , consistent with an recent analysis on a similar ( albeit smaller ) set of African populations ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . The second approach , ALDER ( Loh et al . , 2013; Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) ( Supplementary file 2 ) exploits the fact that correlations between allele frequencies along the genome decay over time as a result of recombination . Linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) can be generated by admixture events , and leaves detectable signals in the genome that can be used to infer historical processes ( Loh et al . , 2013 ) . Following Pickrell et al . ( 2014 ) and the AGVP ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) , we computed weighted admixture LD curves using the ALDER ( Loh et al . , 2013 ) package and the HAPMAP recombination map to characterise the sources and timing of gene-flow events . Specifically , we estimated the y-axis intercept ( amplitude ) of weighted LD curves for each target population using curves from an analysis where one of the sources was the target population ( self reference ) and the other was , separately , each of the other ( non-self reference ) populations . Theory predicts that the amplitude of these 'one-reference' curves becomes larger the more similar the non-self reference population is to the true admixing source ( Loh et al . , 2013 ) . As with the f3 analysis outlined above , for many of the sub-Saharan African populations , Eurasian and hunter-gatherer groups ( such as the Ju\/\u2019hoansi ) produced the largest amplitudes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , reinforcing the contribution of these ancestries to our broad set of African populations . We investigated the evidence for more complex admixture using MALDER ( Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) , an implementation of ALDER which fits a mixture of exponentials to weighted LD curves to infer multiple admixture events ( Figure 3 and Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . In Figure 3A , for each target population , we show the ancestry region of the two populations with the greatest MALDER curve amplitudes , together with the date of admixture , for at most two events . Throughout , we convert time since admixture in generations to a date by assuming a generation time of 29 years ( Fenner , 2005 ) . We note that the inferred admixture dates indicate when gene-flow occurred between populations and not the arrival of groups into an area , which may often be several generations earlier . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 014Figure 3 . Inference of admixture in sub-Saharan Africa using MALDER . We used MALDER to identify the evidence for multiple waves of admixture in each population . ( A ) For each population , we show the ancestry region identity of the two populations involved in generating the MALDER curves with the greatest amplitudes ( coloured blocks ) for at most two events . The major contributing sources are highlighted with a black box . Populations are ordered by ancestry of the admixture sources and dates estimates which are shown \u00b1 1 . 96 \u00d7 s . e . For each event we compared the MALDER curves with the greatest amplitude to other curves involving populations from different ancestry regions . In the central panel , for each source , we highlight the ancestry regions providing curves that are not significantly different from the best curves . In the Jola , for example , this analysis shows that , although the curve with the greatest amplitude is given by Khoesan ( green ) and Eurasian ( dark\u00a0yellow ) populations , curves containing populations from any other African group ( apart from Afroasiatic ) in place of a Khoesan population are not significantly smaller than this best curve ( SOURCE 1 ) . Conversely , when comparing curves where a Eurasian population is substituted with a population from another group , all curve amplitudes are significantly smaller ( Z<2 ) .

This analysis shows that for many populations the reference populations giving the largest amplitudes ( i . e . have the highest rank ) are often non-African groups .

For each of the 48 African populations as a target , we used ALDER to compute the minimum distance over which short-range LD is shared with each of the 47 other African and 12 Eurasian reference populations . Here we show boxplots showing the distribution of minimum inferred genetic distances ( y-axis ) over which LD is shared for each of the reference populations separately ( x-axis ) . We performed two analyses using weighted LD , one using these values of the minimum distance inferred from the data , and another where this distance was forced to be 0 . 5cM ( dotted red line ) . Across all African populations we observe LD correlations with other African populations at genetic distances > 0 . 5cM , with median values ranging between 0 . 7cM when GUMUZ is used as a reference to 1 . 4cM when FULAII is used as a reference . In fact , when we further explore the range of these values across each region separately ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , we note that , as expected , these distances are greater between more closely related groups .

Comparison of the minimum distance to begin computing admixture LD split by region . As in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 except distances are stratified by region . The median minimum distance that all sub-Saharan African populations have correlated LD is always greater than 0 . 5cM . Taken together with the results described in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 , this suggests that all African populations share some LD over short genetic distances , that may be the result of shared demography or admixture .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 025 In general , we find that groups from similar ancestry regions tend to have inferred admixture events at similar times and involving similar sources ( Figure 3 ) , which suggests that genetic variation has been shaped by shared historical events . For every event , the curves with the greatest amplitudes involved a population from a ( usually non-Khoesan ) African ancestry\u00a0region on one side , and either a Eurasian or Khoesan population on the other . To provide more detail on the composition of the admixture sources , we compared MALDER curve amplitudes using source groups from different ancestry regions ( central panel Figure 3A ) . In general , we were unable to precisely define the ancestry of the African source of admixture , as curves involving populations from multiple different ancestry regions were not statistically different from each other ( Z<2; SOURCE 1 ) . Conversely , comparisons of MALDER curves when the second source of admixture was Eurasian ( dark\u00a0yellow ) or Khoesan ( green ) , showed that these groups were usually the single best surrogate for the second source of admixture ( SOURCE 2 ) . MALDER uses as input a genetic map to model the expected decay in linkage disequilibirum . We observed a large amount of shared LD at short genetic distances between different African populations ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Such patterns may result from population genetic processes other than admixture , such as shared demographic history and population bottlenecks ( Loh et al . , 2013 ) . In the main MALDER analysis we present , short-range LD is removed by computing curves at genetic distances\u00a0<2cM where they are correlated between target and reference population . We provide supplementary analyses where this setting was over-ridden by allowing MALDER to start computing LD decay curves at short genetic distances ( from 0 . 5cM ) , irrespective of any short-range correlations in LD between populations . The main difference between the two analyses is that we do not observe previously reported ancient admixture events in Central West African groups ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) without allowing curves to be computed from 0 . 5cM . Interpretation of such results is therefore challenging . Inference of older events relies on modelling the decay of LD over short genetic distances because recombination has had more time to break down correlations in allele frequencies between neighbouring SNPs . We investigated the effect of using European ( CEU ) and Central West African ( YRI ) specific recombination maps ( Hinch et al . , 2011 ) on the dating inference . Whilst dates inferred using the CEU map were consistent with those using the HAPMAP recombination map ( Figure 3B ) , when using the African map dates were consistently older ( Figure 3C ) , although still generally within the last 7ky . There was also variability in the number of inferred admixture events for some populations between the different map analyses ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . Many West African groups show evidence of admixture within the last 4 ky involving African and Eurasian sources . The Mossi from Burkina Faso have the oldest inferred date of admixture , at roughly 5000BCE . Across East Africa Niger-Congo speakers ( orange ) we infer admixture within the last 4 ky ( and often within the last 1 ky ) involving Eurasian sources on the one hand , and African sources containing ancestry from other Niger-Congo speaking African groups from the west , on the other . Despite events between African and Eurasian sources appearing older in the Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic speakers from East Africa , we see a similar signal of very recent Central West African ancestry in a number of Khoesan groups from Southern Africa , such as the Khwe and \/Gui \/\/Gana , together with Malawi-like ( brown ) sources of ancestry in recent admixture events in East African Niger-Congo speakers . Most events involved sources where Eurasian ( dark yellow in Figure 3A ) groups gave the largest amplitudes . In considering this observation , it is important to note that the amplitude of LD curves will partly be determined by the extent to which a reference population has differentiated from the target . Due to the genetic drift associated with the out-of-Africa bottleneck and subsequent expansion , Eurasian groups will tend to generate the largest curve amplitudes even if the proportion of this ancestry in the true admixing source is small ( Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) ( in our dataset , the mean pairwise FS\u2062T between Eurasian and African populations is 0 . 157; Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014source data 2 ) . To some extent this also applies to Khoesan groups ( green in Figure 3A ) , who are also relatively differentiated from other African groups ( mean pairwise FST between Ju\/\u2019hoansi and all other African populations in our dataset is 0 . 095; Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014source data 2 ) . In light of this , and the observation that curves involving groups from different ancestry regions are often not different from each other , it is difficult to infer the proportion or nature of the African , Khoesan , or Eurasian admixing sources , only that the sources themselves contained African , Khoesan , or Eurasian ancestry . Moreover , given uncertainty in the dating of admixture when using different maps and MALDER parameters , these results should be taken as a guide to the general structure of genetics relationships between African groups , rather than a precise description of the gene-flow events . Chromosome painting analysis provides an alternative approach to inferring admixture events which directly uses the similarity in haplotypes ( combination of alleles ) between pairs of individuals . Evidence of haplotype sharing suggests that the ancestors of two individuals must have been geographically proximal at some point in the past , and the distance over which haplotype sharing extends along chromosomes is inversely related to how far in the past coancestry events have occurred . We can use copying vectors inferred through chromosome painting to help identify those populations that share ancestry with a recipient group by fitting each vector as a mixture of all other population vectors ( Leslie et al . , 2015; Montinaro et al . , 2015; van Dorp et al . , 2015 ) . Figure 4A shows the contribution that each ancestry region makes to these mixtures ( MIXTURE MODEL column ) . Almost all groups can best be described as mixtures of ancestry from different regions . For example , the copying vector of the Bantu ethnic group from Cameroon is best described as a combination of 40% Central West African Niger-Congo ( sky blue ) , 30% Eastern Niger-Congo ( orange ) , 25% Southern Niger-Congo ( brown ) , and the remaining 5% coming from West African Niger-Congo ( dark blue ) and Khoesan-speaking ( green ) groups . The mixture model approach is useful for describing coancestry between populations which can result from both admixture and shared evolutionary history . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 026Figure 4 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 030 To explicitly test for and characterise admixture we applied GLOBETROTTER ( Hellenthal et al . , 2014 ) which is an extension of the mixture model approach described above . Admixture inference can be challenging for a number of reasons: the true admixing source population is often not well represented by a single sampled population; admixture could have occurred in several bursts , or over a sustained period of time; and multiple groups may have come together as complex convolution of admixture events . GLOBETROTTER aims to overcome some of these challenges , in part by using painted chromosomes to explicitly model the correlation structure among nearby SNPs , but also by allowing the sources of admixture themselves to be mixed ( Hellenthal et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , the approach has been shown to be relatively insensitive to the genetic map used ( Hellenthal et al . , 2014 ) , and therefore potentially provides a more robust inference of admixture events , the ancestries involved , and their dates . GLOBETROTTER uses the recombination distance between chromosomal chunks of the same ancestry to infer the time since historical admixture has occurred . Throughout we refer to target populations as recipients , any other sampled populations used to describe the recipient population\u2019s admixture event ( s ) as surrogates , and populations used to paint both recipient and surrogate populations as donors . Including closely related individuals in chromosome painting analyses can cause the resulting painted chromosomes to be dominated by donors from these close genealogical relationships , which can mask signals of admixture in the genome ( Hellenthal et al . , 2014; van Dorp et al . , 2015 ) . To help ameliorate this , we painted chromosomes for the GLOBETROTTER analysis by using CHROMOPAINTER to paint each individual from a recipient group with the set of donors which did not include individuals from within their own ancestry region . We additionally painted all ( 59 ) other surrogate populations with the same set of non-local donors , and used these copying vectors , together with the non-local painted chromosomes , to infer admixture . Using this approach , we found evidence of recent admixture in all African populations ( Figure 4A ) . To summarise these events , we show the composition of the admixing source groups as barplots for each population coloured by the contribution from each African ancestry region and Eurasia , alongside the inferred date ( with confidence interval determined by bootstrapping ) and the estimated proportion of admixture ( Figure 4 ) . For each event we also identify the best matching donor population to the admixture sources . Both MALDER and GLOBETROTTER analyses identified Eurasian gene-flow in many but not all African populations ( Figure 4 ) . In several groups from South Africa , and all from Central West Africa ( Ghana , Nigeria , and Cameroon ) , we infer admixture between groups that are best represented by contemporary populations residing in Africa . As GLOBETROTTER is designed to identify the most recent admixture event ( s ) ( Hellenthal et al . , 2014 ) , this observation does not rule out gene-flow from Eurasia back into these groups , but does suggest that subsequent movements between African groups were more important in generating current genetic diversity in these groups . We also do not observe Eurasian ancestry in all East African Niger-Congo speakers , instead finding more evidence for coancestry with Afroasiatic speaking groups . As we show later , Afroasiatic populations have a significant amount of ancestry from outside of Africa , so the observation of this ancestry in several African groups identifies a route by which Eurasian ancestry may have indirectly entered the continent ( Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) . Characterising admixture sources as mixtures allows GLOBETROTTER to infer whether Eurasian haplotypes are likely to have come directly into sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 in which case the admixture source will contain only Eurasian surrogates \u2013 or whether Eurasian haplotypes were brought indirectly together with sub-Saharan groups . In West African Niger-Congo speakers from The\u00a0Gambia and Mali , we infer admixture involving minor admixture sources which contain mostly Eurasian ( dark yellow ) and Central West African ( sky blue ) ancestry , which most closely match the contemporary copying vectors of northern European populations ( CEU and GBR ) or the Fulani ( FULAI , highlighted in gold in Figure 4A ) . The Fulani , a nomadic pastoralist group found across West Africa , were sampled in The\u00a0Gambia , at the very western edge of their current range , and have previously reported genetic affinities with Niger-Congo speaking , Sudanic , Saharan , and Eurasian populations ( Tishkoff et al . , 2009; Henn et al . , 2012 ) , consistent with the results of our mixture model analysis ( Figure 4A ) . Admixture in the Fulani differs from other populations from this region , with sources containing greater amounts of Eurasian and Afroasiatic ancestry , but appears to have occurred during roughly the same period ( c . 0CE; Figure 5 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 031Figure 5 . A timeline of recent admixture in sub-Saharan Africa . For all events involving recipient groups from each ancestry region ( columns ) we combine all date bootstrap estimates generated by GLOBETROTTER and show the densities of these dates separately for the minor ( above line ) and major ( below line ) sources of admixture . Dates are additionally stratified by the ancestry region of the surrogate populations ( rows ) , with all dates involving Niger Congo speaking regions combined together ( All Niger Congo ) . Within each panel , the densities are coloured by the ancestry\u00a0region origin of the surrogates , and in proportion to the components of admixture involved in the admixture event . The integrals of the densities are proportional to the admixture proportions of the events contributing to them . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 031 The Fulani represent the best-matching surrogate to the minor source of recent admixture in the Jola and Manjago , which we interpret as resulting not from specific admixture from them into these groups , but because the mix of African and Eurasian ancestries in contemporary Fulani is the best proxy for the minor sources of admixture in this region . With the exception of the Fulani themselves , the major admixture source in groups across this region is a similar mixture of African ancestries that most closely matches contemporary Gambian and Malian surrogates ( Jola , Serere , Serehule , and Malinke ) , suggesting ancestry from a common West African group within the last 3000 years . The Ghana Empire flourished in West Africa between 300 and 1200CE , and is one of the earliest recorded African states ( Roberts , 2007 ) . Whilst its origins are uncertain , it is clear that trade in gold , salt , and slaves across the Sahara , perhaps from as early as the Roman Period , as well as evolving agricultural technologies , were the driving forces behind its development ( Oliver and Fagan , 1975; Roberts , 2007 ) . It is possible these interactions through North Africa , catalysed by trade across the Sahara , allowed gene-flow from Europe and North Africa back into West Africa . We infer more direct admixture from Eurasian sources in two populations from Kenya , where specifically South Asian populations ( GIH , KHV ) are the most closely matched surrogates to the minor sources of admixture ( Figure 5 ) . Interestingly , the Chonyi ( 1138CE: 1080-1182CE ) and Kauma ( 1225CE: 1167-1254CE ) are located on the Kenyan Swahili Coast , a region where Medieval trade across the Indian Ocean is historically documented ( Allen , 1993 ) , which might explain this Asian admixture . Alternatively , Blench ( 2010 ) notes that the expansion of Arab shipping down the east Coast of Africa in the 10th Century CE masked the Austronesian ( i . e . Oceania and Asia ) influence of the resident coastal culture . The implication is that Austronesians , who are known to have contributed genes to Madagascan populations ( Tofanelli et al . , 2009 ) , may also have been in East Africa at about this time . Further work on these groups will help to understand whether the events we observed in the Chonyi and Kauma represent the first evidence of an Austronesian impact in mainland Africa . In the Kambe , the third group from coastal Kenya , we infer two events , the more recent one involving local groups , and the earlier event involving a European-like source ( GBR , 761CE: 461BCE-1053CE ) . In Tanzanian groups from the same ancestry region , we infer admixture during the same period , this time involving minor admixture sources with Afroasiatic ancestry: in the Giriama ( 1196CE: 1138-1254CE ) , Wasambaa ( 1312CE: 1254-1341CE ) , and Mzigua ( 1080: 1007-1138CE ) . Although the proportions of admixture from these minor sources differ , the major sources of admixture in East African Niger-Congo speakers are similar , containing a mix of Southern Niger-Congo ( Malawi ) , Central West African , Afroasiatic , and Nilo-Saharan ancestries . These events may be an indirect route for European-like gene-flow into East Africa . In the Afroasiatic speaking populations of East Africa , we infer admixture involving sources containing mostly Eurasian ancestry , which most closely matches the Tuscans ( TSI , Figure 4 ) . Visualising the temporal distribution of admixture contributions shows that this ancestry appears to have entered the Horn of Africa in two waves ( at c . 1800 and 0CE in Figure 5 ) as result of admixture into the Afar ( 326CE: 7-587CE ) , Wolayta ( 268CE: 8BCE-602CE ) , Tigray ( 36CE: 196BCE-240CE ) , and Ari ( 689BCE:965-297BCE ) . There are no Middle Eastern groups in our analysis , and this group of events may represent previously observed migrations from the Arabian peninsular at the same time ( Pagani et al . , 2012; Hodgson et al . , 2014a ) . Although Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan speakers were sampled from the same part of East Africa , the ancestry of the major sources of admixture of the former do not contain much Nilo-Saharan ancestry and are predominantly Afroasiatic ( pink ) . In Nilo-Saharan speaking groups ( purple ) , the Sudanese ( 1341CE: 1225\u20131660 ) , Gumuz ( 1544CE: 1384\u20131718 ) , Anuak ( 703: 427-1037CE ) , and Maasai ( 1646CE: 1584-1743CE ) , we infer greater proportions of West ( blue ) and East ( orange ) African Niger-Congo speaking surrogates in the major sources of admixture , indicating both that the Eurasian admixture occurred into groups with mixed Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan\/Afroasiatic ancestry , and a clear recent link with Central and West African groups . Lastly , in two Khoesan speaking groups from South Africa , the \u2260Khomani and Karretjie , we infer very recent direct admixture involving Eurasian groups most similar to Northern European populations , with dates aligning to European colonial period settlement in Southern Africa ( c . 5 generations or 225 years ago; Figure 5 ) ( Hellenthal et al . , 2014 ) . Taken together , and in addition the MALDER analysis above , these observations suggest that gene-flow back into Africa from Eurasia has been common around the edges of the continent , has been sustained over the last 3000 years , and can often be attributed to specific and different historical time periods . Before discussing the impact of the Bantu expansion , we highlight three inferred admixture events involving sources unconnected to that migration . We infer admixture in the Ju\/\u2019hoansi , a San group from Namibia , involving a source that closely matches a local southern African Khoesan group , the Karretjie , and an East African Afroasiatic , specifically Somali , source at 558CE ( 311-851CE ) . Another , older , event in the Maasai ( 254BCE: 764BCE-239CE ) also involves an Afroasiatic source . In contrast the minor source in the event inferred in the Luhya ( 1486: 1428-1573CE ) most closely matches Nilo-Saharan groups . The recent date of this event implies that Eastern Niger-Congo speaking groups ( e . g . the Luhya ) interacted with nearby Nilo-Saharan speakers after the putative arrival of Bantu-speaking groups to Eastern Africa which we discuss below . Most of the sampled groups in this study , and indeed most sub-Saharan Africans , speak a language belonging to the Niger Congo linguistic phylum ( Greenberg , 1972; Nurse and Philippson , 2003 ) . A sub-branch of this group are the so-called 'Bantu' languages \u2013 a group of approximately 500 very closely related languages \u2013 that are of particular interest because they are spoken by the vast majority of Africans south of the line between Southern Nigeria\/Cameroon and Somalia ( Pakendorf et al . , 2011 ) . Given their high similarity and broad geographic range , it is likely that Bantu languages spread across Africa quickly . Bantu languages can themselves be divided into three major groups: northwestern , which are spoken by groups near to the proto-Bantu heartland of Nigeria\/Cameroon; western Bantu languages , spoken by groups situated down the west coast of Africa; and eastern , which are spoken across East and Central Africa ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . Whilst there is linguistic and archaeological consensus that the Bantu heartland was in the general region of southern Nigeria and Cameroon ( Nurse and Philippson , 2003 ) , it is unclear whether eastern Bantu languages were a primary branch that split off before the western groups began to spread south ( the early-split hypothesis ) , or whether this occurred after the start of the movement south ( the late-split hypothesis ) ( Pakendorf et al . , 2011 ) . In a study based on glottochronology , Vansina ( 1995 ) suggests that the expansion started 5kya , whilst estimates based on linguistic diversity are slightly later , around 4kya ( Blench , 2006 ) . This latter date agrees well with the breakthrough of Neolithic technologies , such as tools and pottery , in the archaeology of the Cameroon proto-Bantu heartlands ( Bostoen , 2007 ) and perhaps further south ( Lavachery , 2001 ) , linking the spread of technology and farming with the Bantu expansion . The early split hypothesis suggests that the eastern Bantu migrated directly east from Cameroon , 3\u20132 . 5 kya ( Nurse and Philippson , 2003 ) along the border north of the Congo rainforest , to the Great Lakes Region of East Africa ( Pakendorf et al . , 2011 ) . The late-split hypothesis , on the other hand , suggests that there was an initial spread south , through the equatorial rainforest , with a sub-group splitting east under the rainforest , arriving later in East Africa , potentially around 2kya ( Vansina , 1995 ) . Regardless of the exact route , the expansion spread south , arriving in southern Africa by the late first millennium CE ( Nurse and Philippson , 2003 ) . Recent phylogenetic linguistic analysis shows that the relationships between contemporary languages better match predictions based on the late-split hypothesis ( Holden , 2002; Currie et al . , 2013; Grollemund et al . , 2015 ) , an observation supported by genetic analyses ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . The current dataset does not cover all of Africa . In particular , it contains no hunter-gather groups outside of southern Africa , and no representation of the western Bantu except the Herero from Namibia . Nevertheless , we explored whether our admixture approach could be used to gain insight into the Bantu expansion . Specifically , we wanted to see whether the dates of admixture and composition of admixture sources were consistent with either of the two major models of the Bantu expansion . In the remaining discussion , we make the following assumption: when we observe ancestry from contemporary groups residing in Cameroon ( Semi-Bantu and Bantu ) this is a proxy for direct gene-flow from the origin of the Bantu expansion . Alternatively , higher proportions of ancestry from Southern or Eastern Niger-Congo speakers are the result of subsequent indirect gene-flow through these groups , which we use together with the time of admixture to relate to the Bantu expansion . We note that our interpretation may change with future analyses involving populations from the relatively under-sampled central southern Africa . The major sources of admixture in East African Niger-Congo speakers have both Central West and Southern Niger-Congo ancestry , although it is predominantly the latter ( Figure 4 ) . If admixture in Eastern Niger-Congo speakers results from early movements directly from Central West Africa ( Cameroon surrogates ) then we would expect to see sources with predominantly Central West African ancestry . However , all East African Niger-Congo speakers that we sampled have admixture ancestry from a Southern group ( Malawi ) within the last 2000 years , suggesting that Malawi is more closely related to their Bantu ancestors than Central West Africans on their own . In the SEBantu ( 1109:1051-1196CE ) and AmaXhosa ( 1196CE: 1109-1283CE ) , from east southern Africa , we observe reciprocal admixture events involving major sources most similar to East African Niger-Congo speakers . In west southern Africa , on the other hand , we infer two admixture events in the Herero ( 1834CE: 1805-1892CE and 674CE: 124BCE-979CE ) , and a single date in the Khoesan-speaking Khwe ( 1312; 1152-1399CE ) , both of which involve sources with higher proportions of ancestry from Cameroon ( Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . In a third west southern African group , the ! Xun ( 1312CE: 1254-1385CE ) from Angola , who do not speak a Bantu language , we also infer admixture from a Cameroon-like source at around the same time as the Khwe . The putative Bantu admixture events in Malawi and the Herero occur before those in the ! Xun and Khwe ( Figure 4 ) . This suggests a separate , more recent , arrival for Bantu ancestry in west southern compared to east southern Africa , with the former coming directly down the west coast of Africa and the latter from earlier interactions in central southern Africa ( de Filippo et al . , 2012; Li et al . , 2014 ) . To further explore Bantu ancestry in eastern and southern Africa , we performed additional GLOBETROTTER analyses where we restricted the surrogate populations used to infer admixture ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) to specifically identify ancestry from Cameroon . This analysis allows us to ask whether the indirect Bantu ancestry we observe in East and Southern Niger-Congo speakers can be traced back to the origin of the expansion . When we restrict East African Niger-Congo speakers from having admixture surrogates from either within their ancestry region ( locally ) or Malawi ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , the sources of admixture mainly contained surrogates from the other non-Malawi Southern African Niger-Congo groups ( the AmaXhosa , SEBantu , and Herero ) , reinforcing the relationship between Southern and East African Niger-Congo speakers . With the exception of the Herero , Southern African Niger-Congo speakers show the reverse relationship , choosing East African surrogates when local groups are removed from the inference . Only when both Eastern and Southern African Niger-Congo speakers were restricted from having surrogates from themselves , and each other , did the admixture sources contain significant proportions of Cameroon ancestry ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . By contrast , regardless of which surrogates are removed , the Herero always have inferred major admixture sources that contain a majority of Cameroon ancestry ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We discuss the restricted surrogate analysis in further detail in Supplementary file 3 , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 . In individuals from Malawi we infer a multi-way event with an older date ( 471: 340-631CE ) involving a minor source which mostly contains ancestry from Cameroon , which is , as mentioned , at a similar date to the event seen in the Herero from Namibia . This Bantu admixture appears to have preceded that in other southern Africans by a few hundred years . Given that ancestry from Malawi is often observed in large proportions in the admixture sources of East and Southern African Niger-Congo speakers , and its position between eastern and the most southern groups , Malawi represents the closest proxy in our dataset for the intermediate group that split from the western Bantu . We also see an admixture source in Malawi with a significant proportion of non-Bantu ( green ) ancestry ( 2nd event , minor source in Figure 4 ) , ancestry which we do not observe in the mixture model analysis , but which is also evident in the other east Southern Niger-Congo speakers ( the AmaXhosa and SEBantu ) implying that gene-flow must have occurred between the expanding Bantus and the resident hunter-gatherer groups ( Marks et al . , 2014 ) . In summary , the early date of Bantu admixture in Malawi , its presence as an admixture surrogate across eastern and southern Africa , and the observation of later direct Central West African ( Bantu ) admixture in western south African groups , highlight the complex dynamics , and multiple waves of migration associated with the movement of Bantu agriculturists from the region around Cameroon into southern and eastern Africa . Moreover , our analysis \u2013 in addition to evidence from linguistic phylogenetics ( Currie et al . , 2013; Grollemund et al . , 2015 ) \u2013 provides genetic support for the late-split hypothesis , suggesting that the agriculturist Bantus migrated south around the Congo rainforest before travelling east . Our haplotype-based analyses support a complex picture of recent historical gene-flow in Africa ( Figure 6 ) . Using genetics to infer historical demography will always depend on the available samples and methods used to infer population relationships . Our aim here is to highlight the key gene-flow events that chromosome painting allows us to detect , and to describe their affect on the structure of coancestry:10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 032Figure 6 . The geography of recent gene-flow in Africa . We summarise gene-flow events in Africa using the results of the GLOBETROTTER analysis . For each ethnic group , we inferred the composition of the admixture sources , and link recipient population to surrogates using arrows , the width of which is proportional to the amount it contributes to the admixture event . We separately plot ( A ) all events involving admixture source components from the Bantu and Semi-Bantu ethnic groups in Cameroon; ( B ) all events involving admixture sources from East and Southern African Niger-Congo speaking groups; ( C ) events involving admixture sources from West African Niger-Congo and East African Nilo-Saharan \/ Afroasiatic groups; ( D ) all events involving components from Eurasia . in ( D ) arrows are linked to the labelled 1KGP Eurasian groups .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 15266 . 033 \n Analyses that model the correlations in allele frequencies ( such as those performed here in the Allele frequency differences show widespread evidence for admixture section ) provided initial evidence that the presence of Eurasian DNA across sub-Saharan Africa is the result of gene-flow back into the continent within the last 10 , 000 years ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014; Pickrell et al . , 2014; Hodgson et al . , 2014a ) , and that some groups have ancient ( over 5 kya ) shared ancestry with hunter-gather groups ( Figure 3 ) ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . Whilst the weighted admixture LD decay curves between pairs of populations used by MALDER suggests that this admixture involved particular groups , the interpretation of such events is difficult . Firstly , because our dataset includes closely related groups , it is not always possible to identify a single best matching reference , implying that sub-Saharan African groups share some ancestry with many different extant groups . On the basis of these analyses alone , it is not possible to characterise the composition of admixture sources . Secondly , when ancient events are identified with MALDER , such as in the Mossi from Burkina Faso , where we estimate admixture around 5000 years ago between a Eurasian ( GBR ) and a Khoesan speaking group ( \/Gui \/\/Gana ) , we know that modern haplotypes are likely to only be an approximation of ancestral diversity ( Pickrell and Reich , 2014 ) . Even the Ju\/\u2019hoansi , a San group from southern Africa traditionally thought to have undergone limited recent admixture , has experienced gene-flow from non-Khoesan groups within this timeframe ( Figure 4 ) ( Pickrell et al . , 2012; 2014 ) . There are complications in relating admixture sources to contemporary populations . For example , our analyses indicate that the Mossi share deep ancestry with Eurasian and Khoesan groups ( Figure 3 ) , but any description of the historical event leading to this observation is potentially biased by the discontinuity between extant populations and those present in Africa in the past . It is for this reason that , for older events , we define and refer to broader ancestry regions . So in this case , we describe Eurasian ancestry in general moving back into Africa , rather than British DNA in particular . GLOBETROTTER provides an alternative approach by characterising admixture as occurring between sources that themselves are mixtures of ancestry from contemporary groups . In the situation where no sample group provides a good representation of the admixture source , this additional complexity is likely to be a closer approximation to the truth , with the downside that it is not always possible to assign a specific population label to mixed admixture sources . Using contemporary populations as proxies for ancient groups is not the perfect approach and would be improved by DNA from significant numbers of ancient human individuals , at sufficient quality , with which to calibrate temporal changes in population genetics . When new haplotypes are introduced into a population by gene-flow their fate will be partly be determined by the selective advantage they confer , as well as the chance effects of genetic drift . Selection can occur in response to a number of different factors . Greenlandic Inuit , for example , have adapted genetically to a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Fumagalli et al . , 2015 ) , and one of the strongest signals of selection in the genome is found around the LCT gene ( Bersaglieri et al . , 2004 ) , mutations in which allow individuals to continue to digest milk into adulthood . Responding to changes in their environment , populations living at high altitudes have adapted convergently at different genes involved in hypoxic response: at BHLHE41 in Ethiopians ( Huerta-S\u00e1nchez et al . , 2013 ) ; EPAS1 and EGLN1 in Tibetans ( Yi et al . , 2010 ) ; and at a separate loci within EGLN1 in Andean groups ( Bigham et al . , 2010 ) . There are also several examples of humans adapting in response to infectious disease , for example at the LARGE gene in West Africans ( Grossman et al . , 2013 ) , in response to pressure from Lassa fever , and at CR1 in response to malaria ( Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . Diseases such as malaria are caused by highly polymorphic parasites and movement into new environments might lead to exposure to new strains . An implication of widespread gene-flow is that it can provide a route for potentially beneficial novel mutations to enter populations allowing them to adapt to such change . A recent example of this process is the observation of higher than expected frequencies of the Duffy-null mutation in populations from Madagascar as a result of admixture with African Bantu speaking groups ( Hodgson et al . , 2014b ) . The spread of the Duffy-null allele , an ancient mutation which is thought to have arose at least 30 , 000 years ago ( Hamblin and Di Rienzo , 2000; Hamblin et al . , 2002 ) and confers resistance to Plasmodium vivax malaria , throughout Africa is only possible through contact and gene-flow between populations right across the sub-Sahara . Conversely , the mutation responsible for the sickle cell phenotype , which offers protection against P . falciparum malaria , appears to have recently occurred five times independently in Africa , causing multiple distinct haplotypes to be observed ( Hedrick , 2011 ) . These mutations are young , within the order of 250\u20131750 years old ( Currat et al . , 2002; Modiano et al . , 2008 ) , so will have had limited opportunity to have been moved around by the gene-flow events that we describe . Further work is needed to understand the role of admixture in facilitating adaptation . Epidemiology is the process of identifying the mechanisms that lead to changes in disease prevalence that could result from different environments , behaviours , or genetic backgrounds . Our study helps address these questions by providing a detailed guide to genetic similarity between different ethno-liguistic groups in different geographic locations . This is equally relevant for studies of important infectious disease ( such as malaria ) , as it is for studies of non-communicable diseases which are associated with life-style changes in developing parts of Africa ( see Rotimi and Jorde ( 2010 ) for a review ) . As an example , we detect consistent genetic differences between groups in Central West Africa ( e . g . the Akans and Namkam\/Kasem from Ghana in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , but not in groups from the West and East Africa Niger-Congo ancestry regions ( The\u00a0Gambia and Kenya; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Within these groups we see individuals with a spectrum of different ancestral backgrounds . These observations are specific to groups in our analysis , and cannot be extended to other groups from similar populations; the seven ethnic groups from The\u00a0Gambia were all collected in and around Banjul in the Western District , whereas the three ethnic groups from Ghana were collected from two hospitals in the north ( Navrongo ) and centre ( Kumasi ) of the country . Nonetheless , the potential for genetic differences to underlie difference in disease should be guided by analyses of haplotype sharing between groups . Chromosome painting approaches also provide a quantitative measure of the extent to which self-reported ethnic labels capture genetic relationships , which is also important for controlling for the potential confounding effects of population structure ( Marchini et al . , 2004; Price et al . , 2006 ) , when genome-wide data are unavailable . We see that this can vary extensively from one population to the next ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) ; some individuals who report as coming from the same ethnic group cluster into different groups and other individuals from different ethnicities cluster together . We also show that there are differences in the inferred relationship between populations using analyses genotype based approaches such as PCA and FS\u2062T , and our haplotype based analysis ( Figure 1 ) and TVD ( Figure 2 ) . These results suggest that for some groups , haplotype similarity to other ancestries can vary more substantially than allele frequencies alone . In designing genotyping and sequencing studies these differences can be important in ensuring that the breadth of variation in African populations is adequately covered ( Kwiatkowski , 2005; Gurdasani et al . , 2014 ) . Africa has an exciting and important role in furthering understanding of human biology and disease . An understanding of its patterns of genetic diversity and the historical movements of its people should help in this endeavour . \n The dataset comprises a mixture of 2504 previously published individuals from Africa and elsewhere ( see below ) plus novel genotypes on 1366 sampled by the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network ( MalariaGEN ) Figure 1\u2014source data 1 . The MalariaGEN samples were a subset of those collected at 8 locations in Africa as part of a consortial project on genetic resistance to severe malaria: details of the study sites and investigators involved are described elsewhere ( Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network , 2014 ) . Samples were genotyped on the Illumina Omni 2 . 5M chip in order to perform a multicentre genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) of severe malaria: initial GWAS findings from The\u00a0Gambia , Kenya and Malawi have already been reported ( Band et al . , 2013; Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network , 2015 ) and a manuscript describing findings at all 8 locations is in preparation . The MalariaGEN samples used in the present analysis were selected to be representative of the main ethnic groups present at each of the 8 African study sites . We screened the samples collected at each study site ( typically >1000 individuals ) to select individuals whose reported parental ethnicity matched their own ethnicity . This process identified 23 ethnic groups for which we had samples for approximately 50 unrelated individuals or more . For ethnic groups with more than 50 samples available , we performed a cluster analysis on cohort-wide principle components , generated as part of the GWAS , with the R statistical programming language ( R Development Core Team , 2011 ) using the MClust package ( Fraley et al . , 2012 ) , choosing individuals from the cluster containing the largest number of individuals , to avoid any accidental inclusion of outlying individuals and to ensure that the 50 individuals chosen were , when possible , relatively genetically homogeneous . We note that in several ethnic groups ( Malawi , the Kambe from Kenya , and the Mandinka and Fula from The\u00a0Gambia; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) PCA of the genotype data showed a large amount of population structure . In these cases we chose two sub-groups of individuals from a given ethnic group , selected to represent the diversity of ancestry depicted by the PCs . In several other cases , following GWAS quality control ( see below ) , genotype data for fewer than 50 control individuals were available , and in these cases we chose as many individuals as possible , regardless of the PC-based clustering or case\/control status . We additionally included further individuals from each of four Gambian ethnic groups: the Fulani , Mandinka , Jola , Wollof . The genotype data from these individuals were included as the same individuals are also being sequenced as part of The\u00a0Gambia Genome Variation Project . ( The\u00a0Gambia Genome Variation Project will sequence a number of full genomes from four Gambian ethnic groups as a basis for improving imputation for future West African specific GWAS . ) These subsets included ~30 trios from each ethnic group , information on which was used in phasing ( see below ) . Full genome data from these individuals will be made available in the future . Detailed quality control ( QC ) for the MalariaGEN dataset was performed for a genome-wide association study of severe malaria in Africa and is outlined in detail elsewhere ( Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network , 2015 ) . Briefly , genotype calls were formed by taking a consensus across three different calling algorithms ( Illuminus , Gencall in Illumina\u2019s BeadStudio software , and GenoSNP ) ( Band et al . , 2013 ) and were aligned to the forward strand . Using the data from each country separately , SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <1% and missingness <5% were excluded , and additional QC to account for batch effects and SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was also performed . The post-QC MalariaGEN data was combined with published data typed on the same Illumina 2 . 5\u00a0M Omni chip from 21 populations typed for the 1000 Genomes Project ( 1KGP;\u00a0data downloaded on 16th October 2013 from ftp:\/\/ftp . 1000genomes . ebi . ac . uk\/vol1\/ftp\/technical\/working\/20120131_omni _genotypes_and_intensities\/ ) , including and accounting for duos and trios , and with publicly available data from individuals from several populations from Southern Africa ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) ( 1000 Genomes Project Consortium , 2012; Schlebusch et al . , 2012 ) . We merged samples to the forward strand , removing any ambiguous SNPs ( A to T or C to G ) . Merging was checked by plotting allele frequencies between populations from both datasets , which should be generally correlated ( data not shown ) . We combined these data with further publicly available samples typed on different Illumina ( Omni 1\u00a0M ) chips , containing individuals from southern Africa ( Petersen et al . , 2013 ) and the Horn of Africa ( Somalia\/Ethiopia\/Sudan;\u00a0Pagani et al . , 2012 ) to generate a final dataset containing 4216 individuals typed on 328 , 176 high quality common SNPs . To obtain the final set of analysis individuals we performed additional sample QC after phasing and removed American 1KGP populations ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . We used SHAPEITv2 ( Delaneau et al . , 2012 ) to generate haplotypically phased chromosomes for each individual . SHAPEITv2 conditions the underlying hidden Markov model ( HMM ) from Li and Stephens ( 2003 ) on all available haplotypes to quickly estimate haplotypic phase from genotype data . We split our dataset by chromosome and phased all individuals simultaneously , and used the most likely pairs of haplotypes ( using the \u2013output-max option ) for each individual for downstream applications . We performed 30 iterations of the MCMC and used default values for all other parameters . As mentioned , we used known pedigree relationships to improve the phasing , using family information from both the 1KGP and The\u00a0Gambia Genome\u00a0Variation\u00a0Project . Our dataset included individuals who were known to be closely related ( 1KGP duos and trios; Gambia Genome\u00a0Variation\u00a0Project trios ) and , because we took multiple samples from some population groups , there was also the potential to include cryptically related individuals . After phasing we therefore performed an additional step where we first removed all non-founders from the analysis and then identified individuals with high identity by descent ( IBD ) , which is a measure of relatedness . Using an LD pruned set of SNPs generated by recursively removing SNPs with an R2>0 . 2 using a 50\u00a0kb sliding window , we calculated the proportion of loci that are IBD for each pair of individuals in the dataset using the R package SNPRelate ( Zheng et al . , 2012 ) and estimated kinship using the pi-hat statistic ( the proportion of loci that are identical for both alleles ( IBD=2 ) plus 0 . 5* the proportion of loci where one allele matches ( IBD=1 ) ; i . e . PI_HAT=P ( IBD=2 ) +0 . 5*P ( IBD=1 ) ) . For any pair of individuals where IBD > 0 . 2 , we randomly removed one of the individuals . 327 individuals were removed during this step . With the exception of Peru , post-phasing , we dropped all 1KGP American populations from the analysis dataset ( 97 ASW , 102 ACB , 107 CLM , 100 MXL and 111 PUR ) . We used a subset of the 107 Peruvian individuals that showed a large amount of putative Native American ancestry , with little apparent admixture from non-Amerindians ( data not shown ) . Although Amerindians are not central to this study , and it is unlikely that there has been any recurrent admixture from the New World into Africa , we nevertheless generated a subset of 16 Peruvians to represent Amerindian admixture components in downstream analyses . When this subset was used , we refer to the population as PELII . The removal of these 606 American individuals left a final analysis dataset comprising 3283 individuals from 60 different population groups ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . We used a combination of approaches to explore admixture across Africa . Initially , we employed commonly used methods that utilise correlations in allele frequencies to infer historical relationships between populations . To understand ancient relationships between African groups we used the f3 statistic ( Reich et al . , 2009 ) to look for shared drift components between a test population and two reference groups . We then used ALDER ( Loh et al . , 2013 ) and MALDER ( Pickrell et al . , 2014 ) \u2013 an updated implementation of ALDER that attempts to identify multiple admixture events \u2013 to identify admixture events through explicit modelling of admixture LD by generating weighted LD curves . The weightings of these curves are based on allele frequency differences , at varying genetic distances , between a test population and two putative admixing groups . To identify more recent events we used two methods which aim to more fully model the mixed ancestry in a population by utilising the distribution and length of shared tracts of ancestry as identified with the CHROMOPAINTER algorithm ( Lawson et al . , 2012; Hellenthal et al . , 2014 ) . We outline the details of this analysis below , but note here that , because this approach is based on the comparison and analysis of painted chromosomes , it offers a different perspective from approaches based on comparisons of allele frequencies . For each admixture event we split the admixture sources into their constituent components ( i . e . we used the \u03b2 coefficients inferred by GLOBETROTTER ) at the appropriate admixture proportions . For a given event , these components sum to 1 . We multiplied these components by 100 to estimate the percentage of ancestry from a given event that originates from each donor group . We then assigned each of the components the set of date bootstraps associated with the event . For example , in the Kauma we infer an admixture event with an admixture proportion \u03b1 of 6% involving a minor source containing the following coefficients: Massai 0 . 02 Afar 0 . 15 GBR 0 . 26 GIH 0 . 57 . We multiply each of these coefficients by \u03b1 to obtain a final proportion that each group gives to the admixture event: Massai 0 . 5 Afar 1 GBR 1 . 5 GIH 3 . We assign all the inferred date bootstraps for the Kauma to each of the populations in these proportions . In this example , GIH has twice the density of GBR . We then additionally sum components across the same ancestry\u00a0region to finally arrive at the density plots in Figures 5 . We generated maps with the rworldmaps package in R . To generate arrows , we combined the inferred ancestral components ( i . e . 1ST and 2ND EVENT SOURCES in Figure 3 ) for each population and estimated the proportion of a group\u2019s ancestry coming from each component , summed across all surrogates from a particular country . For example , if an admixture contained source contains components from both the Jola and Wollof ( both from The\u00a0Gambia ) , then these components were added together . As such , the arrows point from the country of component origin to the country of the recipient . We then plot only those arrows which relate to events pertaining to the different broad gene-flow events . For each map , we plot arrows for any event involving the following: An alternative map stratified by time window , rather than admixture component is shown in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 .

{"lay_summary":"Over 90% of adults around the world are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus . Like other closely related viruses , such as those that cause chicken pox and cold sores , an infection lasts for the rest of the person\u2019s life , although the virus generally remains in a latent or dormant state . However , under certain conditions the latent viruses can cause cancers to develop; in fact , it is estimated that such infections are responsible for nearly 2% of all cancer deaths worldwide . One way that healthy human cells prevent cancer is by triggering their own death in a process called apoptosis . The Epstein-Barr virus can block apoptosis , therefore making the cells more likely to become cancerous . Previous research identified one protein in the Epstein-Barr virus that promotes cancer by preventing infected cells from dying as normal . However , even in the absence of this protein , Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells remain resistant to apoptosis . This suggests that the virus has another way of blocking cell death . Price et al . have now used a technique that stresses living cells in a way that reveals which proteins prevent apoptosis to study human cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus . This revealed that soon after infection , the virus could force the human cell to produce MCL-1 , a protein that prevents cell death . Later , the Epstein-Barr virus enlisted a second human protein called BFL-1 , which makes the infected cell further resistant to apoptosis . Price et al . discovered that a protein in the Epstein-Barr virus called EBNA3A controls the production of the MCL-1 and BFL-1 proteins . In the future , developing therapies that target these proteins may lead to new treatments for cancers caused by the Epstein-Barr virus . Such treatments would be likely to have fewer side effects for patients than traditional chemotherapies .","article":"Latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is causally linked to several human cancers . EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation . The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NF\u03baB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells . However , during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis . Therefore , we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1\/NF\u03baB early after infection . We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1\/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ) . This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein . This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis . \n An estimated 15% of cancers worldwide are caused by infectious agents like viruses . Of these , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) was the first human tumor virus discovered and is associated with malignancies of both B lymphocyte and epithelial cell origin . Normally , T cells prevent the development of EBV-associated malignancies and the virus persists quiescently in latently-infected memory B cells . As a result , nearly all adults in the world are latently infected ( Longnecker et al . , 2013 ) , making EBV a particularly widespread and successful pathogen . However , in the absence of a healthy immune system , such as following organ transplant or HIV infection , EBV can transform B cells leading to markedly increased rates of lymphoma in these populations . Primary human B cell infection in vitro by EBV leads to their growth transformation and serves as a model for oncogenesis in EBV-associated lymphomas . This process requires the expression of six viral latent genes: Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 ( EBNA1 ) , EBNA2 , EBNA-LP , EBNA3A , EBNA3C and Latent Membrane Protein 1 ( LMP1 ) ( Longnecker et al . , 2013 ) . EBNA2 , the major viral transcriptional activator and the first to be expressed upon infection , upregulates expression of the other viral EBNA genes as well as host genes ( Wang et al . , 2000; Zimber-Strobl and Strobl , 2001 ) . EBNA2 also activates the expression of the viral oncoprotein LMP1 , which drives the immortalization of the infected B cell into a lymphoblastoid cell line , or LCL , that proliferates indefinitely in culture . Together , the EBV latent oncoproteins mimic key aspects of normal B cell biology , promote proliferation , and inhibit the host innate tumor suppressor response to uncontrolled proliferation ( Allday , 2013; Price and Luftig , 2014 ) . It is well-established that the LMP1 oncoprotein is necessary for continued LCL growth and survival ( Kaye et al . , 1993; Zimber-Strobl et al . , 1996 ) . LMP1 mimics a pro-survival TNF receptor that signals constitutively through the NF\u03baB pathway to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis in transformed cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al . , 2000; Okan et al . , 1995; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . In fact , inhibition of the NF\u03baB pathway activated downstream of LMP1 leads to apoptosis in LCLs . However , recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that , early after infection , B cells rapidly proliferate despite low levels of LMP1 expression and NF\u03baB activation ( Nikitin et al . , 2010; Price et al . , 2012 ) . Surprisingly , these early-infected cells also show no overt signs of apoptosis despite strong activation of the cellular DNA damage response ( Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) . This suggests that in early-infected cells , there is a viral-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling that promotes survival . Several LMP1-independent mechanisms to subvert apoptosis have been described . For example , the viral BCL-2 homologue BHRF1 confers chemoresistance in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) ( Kvansakul et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins exert non-redundant roles in protecting initially infected cells from apoptosis ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt , 2005 ) . In addition , expression of the EBNA3 proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in BL cells and primary B cells by downregulating Bim expression ( Paschos et al . , 2009; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) , thereby making infected cells less \u2018primed\u2019 for apoptosis . The EBNA3 family is also known to epigenetically downregulate additional human genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis ( Allday , 2013; Harth-Hertle et al . , 2013; Hertle et al . , 2009; Paschos et al . , 2012; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . It has been shown that the EBNA3 proteins mediate these epigenetic effects , in part , via interacting with additional proteins in such a way that chromatin architecture can be dramatically altered ( Bazot et al . , 2015; McClellan et al . , 2013 ) . While thought to be generally repressive in nature , recent work has shown that in some instances EBNA3 proteins can activate gene transcription ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . In sum , viral proteins confer several survival advantages to infected cells , which often results in EBV-positive lymphomas that are more difficult to treat than their EBV-negative counterparts ( Kelly et al . , 2006 ) . The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is controlled by complex protein\u2014protein interactions at the surface of mitochondria that regulate the release of cytochrome c ( Youle and Strasser , 2008 ) . These functional interactions can be interrogated with an established approach called \u2018BH3 profiling\u2019 , which uses peptides derived from BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins to identify the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members important for preventing apoptosis in a particular cell ( Del Gaizo Moore and Letai , 2013; Deng et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , molecular characterization of the interface between BH3 domains of these proteins has allowed for the creation of a new class of small molecule inhibitors that promote apoptosis directly in sensitive cell types ( Billard , 2013; Oltersdorf et al . , 2005 ) . These so-called \u2018BH3 mimetics\u2019 are highly specific and show great promise in clinical trials ( Letai , 2008 ) . In this study , we characterized the BH3 profile of uninfected and EBV-infected primary human B cells from early proliferation through long-term outgrowth . We validated these profiles using BH3 mimetics and , importantly , identified a novel virus-specific transition in survival mechanisms between early and late stages of latent infection with implications for therapy of EBV-associated malignancies . \n Previously , our laboratory has identified an early period after EBV infection of primary human B cells where , despite robust virus-mediated proliferation and activation of the pro-apoptotic DNA damage response , there is little expression of the key viral survival factor LMP1 ( Price et al . , 2012 ) . In order to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1 and NF\u03baB activity early after infection , as well as through long-term outgrowth , we performed BH3 profiling to query apoptotic priming at the mitochondria of infected cells . Briefly , this technique works by permeabilizing cells , staining with a mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye , and then treating cells with peptides derived from the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins , including the activator BH3-only protein BIM and the sensitizer BH3-only proteins BAD , PUMA , NOXA , BMF , and HRK ( Figure 1A ) . By measuring mitochondrial depolarization induced by the activator BH3 peptide , BIM , and the pan-apoptotic sensitizer , PUMA , BH3 profiling can measure the overall \u2018priming\u2019 of the cells for apoptosis ( that is , the cell's distance from the apoptotic threshold ) . Further , by measuring depolarization induced by the sensitizer BH3 peptides BAD , NOXA , BMF , and HRK , BH3 profiling can also determine the cell\u2019s specific dependence on particular anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins , including BCL-2 , BCL-XL , MCL-1 , and BFL-1 ( Del Gaizo Moore and Letai , 2013 ) . We BH3 profiled three cell states: ( i ) uninfected B cells purified from the peripheral blood of normal human donors ( B Cell ) , ( ii ) FACS-purified proliferating EBV-infected B cells seven days post-infection ( Prolif ) , and ( iii ) the resulting EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) derived five weeks post-infection from the same donors ( Figure 1B , C ) . Both latently infected cell populations are 100% EBV-positive as shown previously by immuno-fluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 006 BH3 profiling revealed that EBV infection of primary B cells only modestly reduces overall mitochondrial priming ( Figure 1C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 compare 10 \u00b5M Puma from B to Prolif and 1 \u00b5M Bim from B\/Prolif to LCL ) . However , the BH3 profiles revealed marked changes in the BCL-2 family dependencies between the groups suggesting specific , testable hypotheses ( Figure 1D ) . For instance , a cell dependent on BCL-2 or BCL-w for survival would exhibit mitochondrial depolarization upon exposure to Bad , Puma , or Bmf peptides , while a cell dependent upon MCL-1 would depolarize upon exposure to Noxa , Puma , or Bmf peptides . Uninfected B cells depolarized their mitochondria upon treatment with Bad , Puma , or Bmf peptides , but not Noxa or Hrk peptides , indicating reliance on BCL-2 or BCL-w as a pro-survival BCL2 family member ( Figure 1E ) . EBV-infected proliferating B cells ( Prolif ) lost sensitivity to the Bad peptide but remained sensitive to Puma and Bmf , supporting a survival mechanism reliant on both MCL-1 , to block Bad-induced depolarization , and BCL-2\/BCL-w , to block Noxa-induced depolarization ( Figure 1E ) . Finally , LCLs lost sensitivity to Bmf , but sensitivity to Puma did not change between Prolif and LCLs , suggesting additional BFL-1 mediated pro-survival effects in LCLs ( Figure 1E ) . We hypothesized that EBV infection reduces the dependence of B cells on BCL-2 , BCL-xL , or BCL-w for survival given the loss of Bad sensitivity between uninfected and early-infected B cells ( Figure 1E ) . To test this , we treated PBMCs with small molecule BH3 mimetics either concurrent with EBV infection or at the onset of proliferation ( 3 . 5 days post-infection ( dpi ) ) and measured the number of proliferating EBV-infected B cells at 7 dpi using flow cytometry and the proliferation tracking dye CellTrace Violet ( Figure 2A ) . We also assayed the sensitivity of monoclonal LCLs to BH3 mimetic treatment for an equivalent period of time ( Figure 2A ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 007Figure 2 .

Source data for cell counts and apoptosis assays performed with BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2 . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 008 We first tested the sensitivity of EBV-infected cells to ABT-737 , a potent small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2 , BCL-xL , and BCL-w ( Oltersdorf et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with dependence of uninfected B cells on these BCL-2 family members predicted by BH3 profiling , treatment with ABT-737 concurrent with EBV infection resulted in an IC50 in proliferating B cells of ~10 nM ( Figure 2B\u2013C ) . However , when ABT-737 was added to EBV-infected cells after the onset of virus-induced proliferation or to immortalized LCLs we observed high-level ABT-737 resistance with an IC50of ~2\u20134 \u00b5M ( Figure 2B\u2013C ) . ABT-737 promoted apoptosis as measured by caspase 3\/7 activity and Annexin V positivity in uninfected B cells , while proliferating cells at 7 dpi and EBV transformed LCLs were resistant to apoptosis induction ( Figure 2D\u2013E ) . We next sought to confirm BCL-2 as the specific anti-apoptotic protein important for uninfected B cell survival and to further validate our BH3 profiling results . To do this , we used ABT-199 , a specific inhibitor of BCL-2 with minimal off-target effects on BCL-xL or BCL-w ( Souers et al . , 2013 ) . Similar to ABT-737 , EBV induced potent resistance to ABT-199 ( Figure 2F\u2013G ) . Therefore , uninfected human peripheral blood CD19+ B cells depend on BCL-2 for survival and EBV upregulates additional survival proteins to potently suppress apoptosis induced by BCL-2 antagonism . Our BH3 profiling experiments predicted that EBV-infected B cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined protective effects of MCL-1 and BCL-2 during early proliferation with additional protection afforded by BFL-1 in immortalized B cells ( Figure 1E ) . To functionally characterize EBV-regulated survival , we first analyzed BCL-2 family member mRNA expression through B cell outgrowth . We observed that MCL-1 mRNA increased from uninfected B to EBV-infected and proliferating B cells and was further increased in LCLs ( Figure 3A ) . Over the same infection time course , both BCL-2 and BFL-1 were initially downregulated in early proliferating B cells relative to uninfected B cells , then upregulated during LCL outgrowth . These data are consistent with prior transcriptomic analyses from our group ( Price et al . , 2012 ) and others indicating that BCL-2 and BFL-1 are both ultimately upregulated by EBV ( D'Souza et al . , 2004; Henderson et al . , 1991 ) . BCL-2 and MCL-1 protein levels mirror their respective mRNA expression levels during B cell outgrowth ( Figure 3B , quantified in Figure 3C; note there is no viable BFL-1 antibody ) . MCL-1 has been known to be expressed as different isoforms , a long ( MCL-1 ( L ) ) and a short ( MCL-1 ( S ) ) ( Perciavalle et al . , 2012 ) . While the MCL-1 ( L ) isoform is associated with anti-apoptotic activity , MCL1 ( S ) appears to be more important for mitochondrial maintenance; thus , for the scope of this study , we focused primarily on MCL-1 ( L ) , referred to as MCL-1 . The aforementioned data indicate that ABT-737 resistance coincides with MCL-1 induction . We therefore sought to test the importance of MCL-1 in promoting EBV-induced ABT-737 resistance . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 009Figure 3 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 012 We hypothesized that selective inhibition of MCL-1 should render early proliferating cells , but not LCLs , sensitive to drugs that target BCL-2 , namely ABT-737 and the BCL-2 specific inhibitor ABT-199 . Treatment of EBV-infected proliferating B cells at 7dpi or LCLs with either ABT-737 , ABT-199 , or a specific MCL-1 inhibitor A1210477 ( A-1210 ) induced minimal apoptosis ( Figure 3D\u2013E ) . However , when cells were treated with both A-1210 and either ABT-737 or ABT-199 , early proliferating cells , but not LCLs , displayed elevated markers of apoptosis ( Figure 3D\u2013E ) . The combined action of ABT-199 and A-1210 supports the hypothesis generated by BH3 profiling that early-infected cells are more dependent upon MCL-1 and BCL-2 for survival than are LCLs . Further corroborating these findings , we found that indirect inhibition of MCL-1 with flavopiridol led to sensitivity of early-infected cells to BCL-2 antagonists . MCL-1 is a highly labile transcript and protein , and its expression is known to be sensitive to RNA polymerase II stalling induced by CDK9 inhibition ( Gojo et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , the CDK9 inhibitor , flavopiridol , induced rapid decreases in MCL-1 mRNA and protein , while leaving BCL-2 and BFL-1 levels largely unaffected ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B ) . Supporting our A-1210 data , we found that early proliferating cells were more sensitive to apoptosis induced by a combination of flavopirodol and ABT-737 than LCLs ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) ( Leverson et al . , 2015 ) . To determine if BFL-1 was important for survival in LCLs , we utilized the CRISPR\/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the BFL1 ( Bcl2a1 ) coding sequence . We successfully generated a clonal LCL with deletions in both BFL1 alleles as assessed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 3F ) . In one allele there is a 24 base pair ( bp ) in-frame deletion removing a critical loop prior to the BH3 binding cleft and the other a 29 bp deletion in the BFL1 gene resulting in a frameshift mutation and a subsequent premature stop codon at amino acid 50 of the BFL-1 protein . These deletions were clearly evident by RT-PCR ( Figure 3F ) , and , consequently , the mutant \u0394BFL-1 LCL expressed significantly reduced levels of BFL-1 mRNA as compared to WT LCL , LCL expressing Cas9 alone or Cas9-expressing LCLs targeting AAVS1 as a negative control ( Figure 3G ) . \u0394BFL-1 LCLs were significantly more sensitive to treatment with a combination of ABT-737 and A-1210 relative to WT , Cas9 , or AAVS1 sgRNA control LCLs ( Figure 3H ) . These data support the hypothesis defined by our BH3 profiling data that LCLs depend on BFL-1 , MCL-1 , and BCL-2 to protect from apoptosis induced by viral oncoprotein-driven proliferation . A hallmark of B cell biology is rapid proliferation in response to antigen and cytokines leading to maturation via germinal center reactions into the memory and plasma cell lineages ( Goodnow et al . , 2010 ) . In cell culture , mitogens such as the TLR9 ligand CpG DNA as well as T cell derived CD40 ligand and IL-4 ( CD40L\/IL-4 ) promote B cell proliferation similar to EBV infection ( Elgueta et al . , 2009; Krieg et al . , 1995; Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4A\u2013C ) . To assess whether EBV-mediated ABT-737 resistance was linked to B cell proliferation per se or was specific to EBV infection , we stimulated primary B cells with CpG or CD40L\/IL-4 and queried survival . We found that , while EBV induced marked ABT-737 resistance ( IC50\u00a0~3\u20134 \u00b5M ) , both CpG and CD40L\/IL-4 stimulated B cells were significantly more sensitive to ABT-737 ( IC50\u00a0~200 nM ) ( Figure 4D\u2013E ) . Consistently , mitogen-stimulated proliferating B cells had increased caspase 3\/7 activity and Annexin V positivity following ABT-737 treatment ( Figure 4F\u2013G ) while EBV-infected cells displayed only marginally increased activity above basal levels ( Figure 2D\u2013E ) . These data strongly support the hypothesis that resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is specific to EBV-induced proliferation . We next sought to characterize the EBV factors necessary for ABT-737 resistance . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 013Figure 4 . Resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is virus specific .

Of key importance is EBNA2 , a protein encoded initially by transcripts from the B cell-specific viral W promoter ( Wp ) . EBNA2 subsequently activates the viral C promoter ( Cp ) just upstream of Wp which drives increased expression of EBNA2 as well as the other EBNAs ( Price and Luftig , 2014; Woisetschlaeger et al . , 1991 ) ( Figure 5A ) . To assess the role of EBNA2 in ABT-737 resistance of early-infected cells , we used an EBNA2-deleted strain of EBV called P3HR1 ( Hinuma et al . , 1967 ) . Since the EBNA2 deletion in P3HR1 renders the virus incapable of inducing proliferation and transforming primary B cells ( Miller et al . , 1974 ) , we compared the ABT-737 sensitivity of P3HR1-infected cells induced to proliferate using the TLR9 ligand CpG ( P3HR1+CpG ) to uninfected B cells treated with CpG . P3HR1 infection did not alter the sensitivity of CpG-treated proliferating B cells to ABT-737 ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , the prototypical transforming strain , B95-8 , induced marked ABT-737 resistance in the presence or absence of CpG ( Figure 5B ) . These data implicate EBNA2 as a key determinant of the ABT-737 resistance phenotype . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 015Figure 5 . EBV-induced resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is mediated by EBNA3A .

Average IC50 is shown ( inset ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 018 Since EBNA2 controls the expression of other EBV latency genes , it was important to assess the expression of these genes during early P3HR1 and B95-8 infection . At 2 days post-infection , a time point at which ABT-737 resistance first emerges ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , P3HR1-infected cells express high levels of Wp-driven transcripts , but significantly less Cp-driven transcripts including EBNA2 , EBNA3A , and EBNA3C relative to B95-8 infected cells ( Figure 5C ) . As recent work indicates that the viral BCL-2 homologue , BHRF1 , is expressed from Wp during primary B cell infection ( Kelly et al . , 2009 ) and over-expression of BHRF1 can prevent apoptosis induced by ABT-737 in mouse cells ( Kvansakul et al . , 2010 ) , it was important to analyze BHRF1 expression . We found that P3HR1-infected cells expressed similar levels of BHRF1 as B95-8 infected cells ( Figure 5C ) . Therefore , BHRF1 was not associated with ABT-737 resistance in early-infected B cells . Resistance to ABT-737 could be conferred by EBNA2 or by a downstream target such as the EBNA3 proteins . While EBNA3A and EBNA3C are both important for B cell transformation , EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-deleted viruses can induce B cell proliferation for several weeks in culture before aborting long-term outgrowth ( Anderton et al . , 2008; Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . To explore the potential role of the EBNA3 proteins in mediating ABT-737 resistance , we infected PBMCs with mutant strains of EBV deleted for EBNA3A or EBNA3C ( \u25b33A , \u25b33C ) , and treated them with ABT-737 at 3 . 5 dpi then assayed for survival at 7 dpi as before . While \u25b33C-infected proliferating B cells were resistant to ABT-737 ( IC50\u00a0~3 \u00b5M ) similar to WT B95-8-infected cells ( IC50\u00a0~4 \u00b5M ) , the \u25b33A-infected proliferating B cells remained highly sensitive to ABT-737 ( ~200 nM ) ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , from our initial infections we were able to derive a \u25b33A LCL , similar to that reported by others ( Hertle et al . , 2009; Skalska et al . , 2010 ) , and we again observed enhanced sensitivity to ABT-737 and ABT-199 in the \u25b33A LCL ( IC50\u00a0~60 nM and\u00a0~180 nM , respectively ) relative to a donor-matched WT LCL ( IC50\u00a0~4 \u00b5M ) ( Figure 5E , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . This result was unexpected as LMP1-mediated NF\u03baB activity in a \u25b33A LCL should induce BFL-1 to rescue ABT-737 resistance ( D'Souza et al . , 2004; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1E ) . To further characterize the nature of EBNA3A-mediated ABT-737 resistance , we subjected \u25b33A and WT LCLs from the same donor to BH3 profiling . We found that the \u25b33A LCL , in contrast to WT , was sensitive to both the Bad and Bmf peptides indicating BCL-2 dependence and an absence of BFL-1 and MCL-1 protection similar to the uninfected B cell state ( Figure 6A ) . Mechanistically , we found that \u25b33A LCLs expressed significantly less BFL-1 at the mRNA level , while the BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA levels were similar to WT , if not slightly elevated ( Figure 6B and additional clones in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Loss of BFL-1 mRNA expression was not due to selective pressure applied during outgrowth of \u25b33A LCL as EBNA3A-ERT2 fusion protein expressing LCLs lost or gained BFL-1 expression upon HT withdrawal or addition , respectively , in a stable LCL ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C ) . While BH3-profiling predicted a loss of MCL-1 activity , MCL-1 mRNA , protein , and protein stability were unchanged in the \u25b33A LCL compared to WT ( Figure 6B\u2013D ) . Instead , we discovered that MCL-1 localization to mitochondria was defective in the \u25b33A LCL ( Figure 6E ) . These data strongly corroborate the BH3 profiling results , which indicated a lost of MCL-1 acitivity at the mitochondria . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 019Figure 6 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 22509 . 021 We further sought to determine how EBNA3A regulates BFL-1 and specifically to characterize whether the loss of BFL-1 mRNA in the \u25b33A LCL was due to a transcriptional defect ( Figure 6B ) . Indeed , when we isolated nascent mRNAs using a thiolated-RNA pull down method we found that \u25b33A LCLs were only transcribing\u00a0~15% as much BFL-1 mRNA as WT LCLs ( Figure 6F ) . Furthermore , we found that decreased BFL-1 transcription in \u25b33A LCLs was correlated with decreased RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) , activated Pol II ( phospho Serine 5 ) , and activating histone marks ( H3K27ac , H3K9ac , and H3K4me3 ) accumulating at the BFL-1 transcription start site ( TSS ) ( Figure 6G ) . EBNA3 proteins often regulate gene expression through long-range enhancers ( Bazot et al . , 2015; McClellan et al . , 2013; Schmidt et al . , 2015 ) . To evaluate the role of EBNA3A in regulating chromatin structure to promote BFL-1 transcription , we used chromatin conformation capture to query the interactions between regions of open chromatin up- and downstream of the BFL-1 gene in WT and \u25b33A LCLs . We discovered two genomic regions upstream of the BFL-1 gene that were strongly associated with the TSS in WT LCLs but less so in \u25b33A LCLs ( Figure 6H ) . Using LCL ChIP-Seq data ( Schmidt et al . , 2015; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , we found that one locus is bound by EBNA3A within a known EBV Super Enhancer ( 39 kb upstream of the BFL-1 TSS ) and the other region contains a single RelA peak , an NF\u03baB transcription factor subunit strongly activated by LMP1 ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 6I ) . These data support an important new role for EBNA3A in coordinating NF\u03baB-mediated regulation of BFL-1 transcription in LCLs . Finally , to demonstrate that EBNA3A is responsible for ABT-737 resistance in EBV-infected B cells , we rescued EBNA3A expression in trans in \u25b33A LCLs . We found that EBNA3A re-expression was sufficient to restore ABT-737 resistance similar to WT LCLs ( Figure 6J\u2013K ) . Therefore , we conclude that EBNA3A plays an important role in EBV-mediated resistance to BCL-2 antagonists and survival in response to potent proliferative signals during both early and late stages of B cell growth transformation . \n Suppression of apoptosis by EBV is essential for establishment of latent infection in the immune-competent host and promotes tumorigenesis in the immune suppressed host . While EBV encodes two putative BCL-2 homologues , these proteins are not required for survival after the first 24 hr following B cell infection ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt , 2005 ) . Rather , constitutive NF\u03baB signaling from the viral oncoprotein LMP1 , a TNFR homologue , is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected , proliferating cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al . , 2000; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . However , the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV is driven by expression of the viral EBNA transcription factors ( EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , and LP ) in the absence of appreciable LMP1 or NF\u03baB activity ( Price et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , this early period of hyper-proliferation activates a growth-suppressive DNA damage response , which would be expected to promote apoptosis ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . We , therefore , sought to identify the mechanism of survival during early infection by using BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial control of apoptosis prior to and through latent EBV infection and outgrowth of primary human B cells into LCLs . While BH3 profiling has been previously performed on virus-infected cells ( Cojohari et al . , 2015 ) , this study focused on HCMV and was limited to a single EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line , Akata , which expresses only the viral EBNA1 protein . In our BH3 profiling study , we found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1 , followed by BFL-1 . Mechanistically , we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation . The importance of EBNA3A in B cell transformation and survival was previously recognized , but our studies now define the molecular basis for the inhibition of apoptosis . While both EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress the pro-apoptotic protein Bim ( Paschos et al . , 2009 ) , only EBNA3A was required to mitigate resistance to a BCL2 antagonist through outgrowth . EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription . Transcription of BFL-1 was previously shown to be regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 ( Pegman et al . , 2006 ) as well as LMP1-induced NF\u03baB ( Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . Our work now indicates that EBNA3A coordinates a chromatin architecture through an EBV super enhancer that facilitates NF\u03baB-mediated activation of BFL-1 transcription . Therefore , our studies highlight a new cooperative role among EBNA3A , EBNA2 , and LMP1 in transcriptional activation important for EBV-immortalized cell survival . The importance of MCL-1 in early EBV-infected human B cells coupled with the critical role of MCL-1 in germinal center ( GC ) formation and memory B cell survival in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al . , 2010 ) is consistent with the GC model of EBV infection . The GC model posits that EBV infection of na\u00efve B cells promotes B cell maturation mimicking the GC reaction to access the long-lived memory B cell compartment and thus persisting for the lifetime of the host ( Burns et al . , 2015; Roughan and Thorley-Lawson , 2009 ) . Our data support this model in that early infection of B cells by EBV promotes MCL-1 as a critical apoptotic regulator similar that observed for GC B cells in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , MCL-1 copy number gains and mutations are often found in B cell lymphomas ( Wenzel et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , the mechanism by which EBNA3A enhances MCL-1 function at the mitochondria may provide broad insight into apoptotic regulation during B-cell maturation and lymphomagenesis . The early phase of EBV infection where EBNAs are expressed with little or no expression of LMPs is known as latency IIb ( Price and Luftig , 2015 ) . The latency IIb expression pattern has also been observed by immuno-histochemical analysis in EBV-positive HIV-associated lymphomas , post-transplant lymphomas , in acute infectious mononucleosis , and in tumors of humanized mouse models of EBV infection ( Price and Luftig , 2015 ) . Indeed , a recent study found that an EBV recombinant lacking LMP1 was capable of forming B cell tumors in a humanized mouse model ( Ma et al . , 2015 ) . The survival of these cells as well as those in other latency IIb expressing tissues likely depends on EBNA3A and MCL-1 , while latency III cells expressing LMP proteins and high level NF\u03baB signaling are likely to be less primed and to rely on BFL-1 . As BH3 profiling has been a powerful predictive tool for chemotherapeutic responses in leukemias ( Montero et al . , 2015 ) , our new findings suggest that such an approach could allow for better treatment decisions for EBV-associated malignancies . \n Buffy coats were obtained from normal human donors through the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center ( Houston , TX ) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated by Ficoll Histopaque-1077 gradient ( Sigma , H8889 ) . CD19+ B cells were purified from PBMCs using the BD iMag Negative Isolation Kit ( BD , 558007 ) . Lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated as previously described ( Price et al . , 2012 ) and maintained in RPMI plus 10% FBS ( Corning ) , 2 mM L-Glutamine , 100 U\/ml penicillin , 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus was produced from the B95-8 Z-HT cell line as previously described ( Johannsen et al . , 2004 ) . P3HR1 was generated from P3HR1 Z-HT cells ( kind gift of Elliott Kieff , Harvard Medical School ) . Two independent sources of EBNA3A and EBNA3C deletion viruses were used in these studies for validation as well as an EBNA3A-ERT2 regulated recombinant ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . Detailed information on mutant viruses below . TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotide ( ODN 2006 ) was purchased from IDT and used at 2 . 5 \u00b5g\/ml ( Krieg et al . , 1995 ) . Human recombinant interleukin-4 ( PeproTech , AF200-04 ) was used at 20 ng\/mL . HA-tagged CD40 ligand was purchased from ( R&D Systems , 6420 CL ) and used at 5 ng\/ml in combination with an anti-HA cross-linking peptide ( R&D Systems , MAB060; RRID:AB_10719128 ) at a concentration of 0 . 2 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l . Initial BH3 profiling experiments were performed with cell populations and lines that were not mycoplasma tested . However , subsequently we instituted routine mycoplasmia testing using a PCR-detection kit ( Sigma-Aldrich , MP0035-1KT ) . While the majority of cell lines were negative for mycoplasma , we did detect mycoplasma in some lines . These lines were cured with ciprofloxacin treatment . We repeated several key experiments in those lines that were found to be positive and then cured , including ABT-737 and ABT-199 sensitivity assays , and found that mycoplasma contamination had no bearing on the results . Two independent sources of EBNA3A and EBNA3C deletion viruses were used in these studies for validation . One set was previously described ( Anderton et al . , 2008 ) . The other was generated by en passant mutagenesis of the EBV p2089 BACmid ( Delecluse et al . , 1998 ) using GS1783 E . coli ( Braman , 2010 ) . Primer sequences used to generate these mutants are listed in Supplementary file 1 . After screening , desired EBV BACmids were transferred to BM2710 E . coli which were then used to infect 293 cells as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2005 ) . Recombinant viruses were produced by co-transfecting BAC-containing , selected 293 cells with pCDNA3-2670-gp110 , pSG5-Zta , and pCDNA3-Rta into cells using polyethylenimine ( PEI ) and OptiMEM ( Invitrogen ) . 24 hr after transfection , media was changed to antibiotic-free 10% FBS containing RPMI 1640 and harvested 48 hr afterwards . After harvesting , transfected cells were replenished with fresh media for 24 hr , at which point virus was harvested again . Harvests were pooled and concentrated 100-fold in a 100 kDa Amicon spin-filter . In addition to the EBNA3A deletion and stop variants , a recombinant virus was used that encodes EBNA3A-ERT2 , which is a fusion of a modified estrogen receptor to EBNA3A . This virus was previously used to define EBNA3A regulated genes and its generation was described here ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . EBV infections were performed by adding 100 \u00b5L B95-8 virus ( from Z-HT supernatants ) or 200 \u00b5L P3HR1 virus to 1 \u00d7 106 PBMCs for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator followed by washing the cells once with PBS and resuspending cells in RPMI with 15% FBS serum ( Corning ) , 2 mM L-Glutamine , 100 U\/ml penicillin , 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 5 \u00b5g\/mL Cyclosporine A ( Sigma ) . Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 ( Nikitin et al . , 2010 ) . For P3HR1 infections , viral stocks were normalized to B95-8 by immunofluorescence of EBNA-LP in primary B cells two days post infection . For WT , \u25b33A , and \u25b33C BAC viruses , 1 \u00d7 105 green Raji units ( GRU; Raji , RRID:CVCL_2699 ) were used to infect 1 \u00d7 106 PBMCs as previously described ( Skalska et al . , 2013 ) . The BFL-1 CRISPR\/Cas9 mutant LCL was generated by the Duke Functional Genomics Shared Resource . Cas9-expressing LCLs ( lentiCas9-EGFP; Addgene #63592 ) were transduced with one of three short-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) that were specific to BFL-1 exon 1 and grown out under puromycin selection ( lentiGuide-Puro; Addgene #52963 ) . Each sgRNA was screened for efficiency of Cas9 cleavage by Surveyor nuclease assay and for reduced BFL-1 mRNA expression . LCLs transduced with the sgRNA resulting in both Cas9 cleavage of the target site and the most reduced mRNA expression were then serially diluted to obtain a clonal population . Clonality was ascertained by TOPO TA cloning ( Invitrogen , Cat #45003 ) . To track proliferation , cells were stained with CellTrace Violet ( Invitrogen , C34557 ) . Cells were first washed in FACS buffer ( 5% FBS in PBS ) , stained with the appropriate antibody for 30 min-1hr at 4\u00b0C in the dark , and then washed again before being analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II . Proliferating infected B cells were sorted to a pure population of CD19+\/CellTraceVioletlo on a MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter at the Duke Cancer Institute Flow Cytometry Shared Resource . Mouse anti-human CD19 antibody ( clone 33-6-6; gift from Tom Tedder , Duke University Medical School ) conjugated with either APC or PE was used as a surface B-cell marker in flow cytometry . Plate-based BH3 profiling was performed on primary B cells , early-infected hyperproliferating B cells , and LCLs at 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells\/well . Cells were resuspended at 2x and incubated for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) in T-EB solution containing 4 \u03bcM JC-1 , 40 ug\/mL oligomycin , 0 . 02% digitonin , and 20 mM 2-mercaptoethonal . Peptides were diluted in T-EB at 2x concentration and aliquoted per well in a black 384-well plate ( Corning 3575 ) , to which the cell\/dye solution was added 1:1 . The fluorescence at 590 nM from each well was read on a plate reader every 5 min at RT . Depolarization of the mitochondria was calculated as a percentage loss normalized to the solvent-only control ( DMSO , 0% depolarization ) and the positive control ( FCCP , 100% depolarization ) . Analysis was performed using technical triplicates of five biological replicates , where outliers were eliminated if there was poor signal or if the Puma2A inert control showed high background depolarization . Cells were pelleted and washed in PBS , and then lysed in 0 . 1% Triton-containing buffer with Complete protease inhibitors . All protein lysates were run on NuPage 4\u201312% gradient gels ( LifeTechnology ) and transferred to PVDF membrane ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and stained with primary antibody overnight at\u00a0+4\u00b0C , followed by a wash and staining with secondary HRP-conjugated antibody for 1 hr at room temperature . All antibodies used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . Total RNA was isolated from cells by using a Qiagen RNeasy kit and then reverse transcribed to generate cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Quantitative PCR was performed by using SYBR green ( Quanta Biosciences ) in an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus instrument . Results were normalized to SETDB1 , a control mRNA found to not change expression from resting B cells through EBV-immortalization ( Price et al . , 2012 ) or GNB2LI ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) . Cells were treated with various concentrations of ABT-199 ( ChemieTek , CT-A199 ) , ABT-737 ( Selleckchem , S1002 ) , flavopiridol ( Sigma , F3055 ) , or A1210477 ( Selleckchem , S7790 ) . All drugs were resuspended in DMSO . Cells were stained with fluorescent conjugates of Annexin-V ( eBioscience , 88-8007-72; RRID:AB_2575165 ) or incubated with CellEvent Caspase 3\/7 Green Detection Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific , C10423 ) . Cell death is reported as a percentage of Annexin-V positive or caspase 3\/7-positive of total events . Survival is plotted as the percentage of CD19+ , proliferating B cells normalized by input volume using the FACS Canto II high-throughput 96-well sampler to DMSO-treated control cells . Protein stability was assayed by incubating LCLs in 15 \u00b5M cycloheximide ( Sigma , C1988 ) . Time points were taken immediately before addition ( 0 min ) , and then at 30 , 60 , and 120 min after addition of cycloheximide and analyzed by western blot loading 10 \u00b5g of protein per lane . Mitochondria isolation was performed using a mitochondria isolation kit ( Thermo Scientific ) on 50 million cells . Cells were lysed with Reagents A , B , and C as supplied by the manufacturer\u2019s kit . Mitochondrial pellets were lysed in 0 . 1% Triton lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Total , cytoplasmic , and mitochondrial fractions were measured by Bradford assay and 5 \u03bcg protein was loaded per lane . The ability to capture nascently transcribed RNA was modified from previously described work ( Payne et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , cells were treated with 200 \u00b5M 4-thiouridine ( 4sU ) for one hour before total RNA was harvested in 1 mL of TRIzol ( Life Technologies ) . Nascently transcribed RNA over this time period incorporated 4sU , which was subsequently biotinylated and pulled down using streptavidin MyOne C1 Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . RNA was reverse transcribed and qPCR was performed as described above . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) was performed as described previously ( Bazot et al . , 2015 ) using a Millipore ChIP assay kit ( 17-295 ) and sonicated with a standard Diagenode Bioruptor sonicator . All antibodies used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . Chromatin Conformation Capture ( CCC ) was performed as described previously ( Hag\u00e8ge et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , chromatin was crosslinked with formaldehyde and isolated from LCLs , whereupon it was digested overnight with the restriction enzyme HindIII . Digested chromatin was then diluted and ligated overnight . Reversal of crosslinks , proteinase K digestion , and phenol-chloroform extraction yielded DNA circles that were assayed by TaqMan qPCR . All oligos and probes used can be found in the Supplementary file 1 . pCEP-EBNA3A , an episomal expression vector , was introduced into LCLs using the MicroPorator MP-100 ( Digital Bio ) . Cells were incubated with DNA and shocked at 1300V for 1 pulse of 30 ms and then recovered in 15% FBS containing RPMI . Cells were co-transfected with an additional pCEP-TdTomato plasmid to mark transfected cells with red fluorescence . Student\u2019s 2-way ANOVA and two-tailed t-test were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 software . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , and ***p<0 . 001 were considered significant . IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad and 95% confidence intervals were reported .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["microbiology and infectious disease","cancer biology"],"id":"elife-22509-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"Genes are sections of DNA that encode the instructions to make proteins . When a gene is switched on , the section of DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) in a process called transcription . These messenger RNAs are then used as templates for protein production . In animals , plants and other eukaryotic organisms , an enzyme called RNA polymerase II is responsible for making messenger RNA molecules during transcription . This enzyme is made up of several proteins , the largest of which contains a long tail , called the carboxy-terminal domain . This domain is crucial for transcription because it serves as a landing platform for other enzymes that help to make the RNA molecules . The carboxy-terminal domain contains multiple repeats of a string of seven amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) . Normally , each repeat contains three amino acids called serines . However , in humans and other mammals , one of these serines is often substituted with another amino acid called lysine instead . This lysine ( referred to as Lysine-7 ) was known to be modified by the addition of a chemical group called an 'acetyl' tag , but it was not clear how this tag affected transcription . Dias , Rito , Torlai Triglia et al . carried out an in-depth study into how Lysine-7 is modified in mouse cells , and what effects these modifications have on transcription . The experiments show that Lysine-7 can also be modified by the addition of a different chemical group , called a 'methyl' tag . This new modification is also found in flies , worms and human cells , which suggests that it is generally important for transcription . Next , Dias , Rito , Torlai Triglia et al . found that in mouse stem cells , methyl tags are added to Lysine-7 during the earliest steps of transcription , before the acetyl tags are added . Further experiments show that a balance between the addition of methyl tags and acetyl tags to Lysine-7 fine-tunes the activity of RNA polymerase II . These findings add to our understanding of how cells control the activity of RNA polymerase II at different genes . Future challenges are to find out which enzymes are responsible for adding and removing these chemical tags , and how the balance between the methyl and acetyl modifications is controlled .","article":"Dynamic post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) coordinates the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA . Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain ( CTD ) , which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7 . Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation , whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation . In vertebrates , the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7 , which can be acetylated ( K7ac ) . Here , we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues ( K7me1 and K7me2 ) . K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation . In contrast , K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation , Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression . We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters , which fine-tunes gene expression levels . \n Transcription of protein-coding genes is a complex process involving a sequence of RNA processing events that occur at different stages of the transcription cycle . Co-transcriptional recruitment of chromatin modifiers and RNA processing machinery is modulated through a complex array of post-translational modifications at the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of RPB1 , the largest subunit of RNAPII . This unique domain constitutes a docking platform for protein complexes that cap , splice and polyadenylate newly-made RNAs ( Bentley , 2014; Buratowski , 2009; Egloff et al . , 2012; Eick and Geyer , 2013; Hsin and Manley , 2012 ) . The CTD also integrates signaling cascades that , for example , coordinate the DNA damage response and chromatin remodeling with gene expression ( Munoz et al . , 2009; Winsor et al . , 2013 ) . The CTD is a large , structurally disordered domain composed of a tandem heptapeptide repeat structure with the canonical sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7 . Extensive remodeling of the CTD occurs during distinct steps of the transcription cycle ( Buratowski , 2003 , 2009 ) . RNAPII binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state , before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Serine-5 ( S5p ) and Serine-7 ( S7p ) , marking the earliest stages of transcription ( Akhtar et al . , 2009; Chapman et al . , 2007; Tietjen et al . , 2010 ) . Productive elongation is characterized by an increase in phosphorylation of Serine-2 ( S2p ) throughout gene bodies , with the highest levels found around transcription end sites ( TES ) . S5p is important for recruitment of the capping machinery , while S2p is involved in the recruitment of splicing and polyadenylation factors ( Corden , 2013; Ghosh et al . , 2011; Gu et al . , 2013; Lunde et al . , 2010 ) . Although the tandem repeat structure of the CTD was acquired very early in eukaryotic evolution , and general features of serine phosphorylation are fairly conserved from yeast to mammals , the number of repeats is highly variable among different taxa ( Chapman et al . , 2008; Yang and Stiller , 2014 ) . The most complex multicellular organisms , such as vertebrates , generally have longer CTDs ( e . g . 52 heptad repeats in mammals ) , whereas Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabditis elegans and unicellular yeast have 44 , 42 and 26\u201329 copies , respectively . The mammalian CTD retains a core of 21 consensus repeats , but has accumulated a diversity of non-consensus repeats , particularly at its most C-terminal region ( Figure 1a ) . In vertebrates , non-canonical amino-acid residues occur most frequently at the seventh position of the heptapeptide repeat , and the most frequent substitution replaces the canonical S7 residue with a lysine ( K7; Figure 1a ) . The number of non-canonical K7-containing repeats increases from zero in yeast to one , three and eight repeats in C . elegans , D . melanogaster and vertebrates , respectively ( Figure 1b ) . Previous work has shown that non-canonical CTD-K7 residues can be acetylated , and that CTD-K7ac is associated with transcriptional pausing at epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) -inducible genes in mouse fibroblasts ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . Evolutionary analyses also suggest that CTD-K7ac played a role in the origin of complex Metazoan lineages ( Simonti et al . , 2015 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 003Figure 1 . Structure and evolutionary conservation of the C-terminal domain of RPB1 . ( a ) Mouse RPB1 CTD is composed of 52 heptapeptide repeats with consensus amino-acid sequence YSPTSPS , which is represented 21 times at the most proximal CTD region . Non-consensus amino acids are enriched for at the distal region . Most abundant non-consensus residues are lysines , all found at heptad position 7 ( K7; represented in red ) . Other non-consensus residues are represented in blue . ( b ) Amino-acid sequence alignment of the most distal part of the CTD containing K7 residues across different species: Mus musculus ( M . mus ) ; Xenopus tropicalis ( X . tro ) ; Danio rerio ( D . rer ) ; Drosophila melanogaster ( D . mel ) ; and , Caenorhabditis elegans ( C . ele ) . Conservation of CTD K7 residues is highlighted in yellow . CTD repeat numbering was done according to the mouse CTD sequence between repeats 35 and 49 , and aligned to the other species CTDs from the position of the repeat containing the first lysine in each organism .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 003 To further explore the increasing complexity of CTD modifications over evolution , their temporal sequence , and how they interplay with each other , we have investigated the possibility of additional modification of non-canonical CTD residues . We identify mono- and di-methylation of CTD-K7 residues in both vertebrates and invertebrates . We produce new antibodies specific to CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 and show that these novel modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of S5 and S7 , upstream of S2 phosphorylation . Using biochemical and genome-wide approaches , we show that CTD-K7 methylation is present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA , but defines the earliest stages of the transcription cycle . Through detailed analysis of abundance and distribution of different CTD modifications at gene promoters in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells , we show that gene expression levels depend on the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation . \n To study the importance of non-consensus CTD-K7 residues on cell viability and their potential for post-translational methylation , we generated stable mouse NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing \u03b1-amanitin-resistant RPB1 bearing CTD-K7 mutations ( Figure 2a ) . In this system , the endogenous \u03b1-amanitin-sensitive RPB1 is continually depleted and functionally replaced by the resistant variant ( Nguyen et al . , 1996 ) . CTD-K7 residues were mutated into serine ( S7 ) residues to restore the consensus sequence of the CTD heptapeptide . We avoided the more traditional lysine to arginine substitution , as a non-canonical arginine residue is present at the CTD in position 7 of repeat 31 and undergoes methylation in vivo ( Sims et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , artificial expansion of R7 residues in the CTD could confound our investigation of CTD-K7 methylation . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 004Figure 2 . Mutation of CTD-K7 to -S7 residues does not interfere with RPB1 stability , phosphorylation or subcellular localization .

The nomenclature of the cell lines is indicative of the number of K7 residues retained in each \u03b1-amanitin-resistant Rpb1 constructs . ( b ) Expression and phosphorylation levels of RPB1 in cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant YFP-Rpb1 construct . Levels of total RPB1 , YFP , S5p , S7p and S2p were analyzed by western blotting in total cell extracts from NIH-3T3 ( 3T3 ) and from NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing wild-type ( 8K ) and mutant ( 0K ) RPB1 . Hypo- ( IIa ) and hyperphosphorylated ( II0 ) isoforms of YFP-Rpb1 constructs migrate slower than wild-type construct detected in 3T3 due to the YFP tag ( Y-IIa and Y-II0 respectively ) . Total RPB1 was detected with an antibody to the N-terminus of RPB1 . \u03b1-tubulin was used as loading control . For each blot\/antibody , samples were run in the same gel , and re-ordered to improve clarity . Complete western blots are shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 . ( c ) Whole-cell detection of RPB1 expression in wild-type ( 8K ) , mutant ( 0K ) and untransfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts .

For total RPB1 , YFP , S5p and S2p , two different cell lines ( a and b ) stably expressing the 8K and 0K constructs were analyzed , but only one of each was selected for Figure 2a ( 8K-a and 0K-a ) and used in further analyses . Total RPB1 was detected with an antibody to the N-terminus of RPB1 . RPB1 , RNA polymerase II large subunit; YFP , yellow flourescent protein . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 005 To explore the effect of the number and position of different K7 residues in the mouse CTD , we generated \u03b1-amanitin-resistant YFP-Rpb1 ( YFP fusion at N-terminus of Rpb1 gene ) constructs containing different number of K7-to-S7 mutations ( Figure 2a ) . Mutant 0K does not have any K7 residues\u00a0and therefore resembles a yeast-like CTD , but with 52 repeats . Mutant 1K retains only one K7 , on repeat 35 , which is conserved in D . melanogaster ( aligning from C-terminus of CTD ) and is the only K7 residue present in C . elegans . Mutant construct 3K has three K7 residues present at repeats 35 , 40 and 47 , all of which are conserved in D . melanogaster . Finally , we used a wild-type murine Rpb1 construct ( 8K ) , which contains all eight vertebrate-conserved K7 residues , as a control for expression and \u03b1-amanitin selection . We produced viable mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblast lines that express each of the four constructs and show stable YFP-RPB1 expression for more than one month in culture and after several passages under \u03b1-amanitin selection . Viability of cells expressing \u03b1-amanitin-resistant RPB1 was previously shown for K7-to-R7 mutations ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) or for other CTD constructs without all lysines , where Rpb1 contained only consensus heptapeptide repeats ( Chapman et al . , 2005; Hintermair et al . , 2012 ) . To determine whether non-canonical CTD-K7 residues are important for CTD phosphorylation , we performed western blotting using total protein extracts from stable NIH-3T3 clones expressing 8K ( wild-type ) or 0K constructs ( Figure 2b , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ; extracts from untransfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were analyzed as an additional control . Total expression levels of YFP-RPB1 fusion proteins , detected using an antibody against the N-terminus of RPB1 , were similar to the levels of endogenous RPB1 in the parental NIH-3T3 cell line . As expected , YFP-RPB1 fusion proteins migrate at a higher molecular weight than endogenous RPB1 , confirmed using antibodies that detect the YFP tag ( Figure 2b , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Western blot analyses of CTD phosphorylation using highly specific antibodies against S5p , S7p and S2p ( Brookes et al . , 2012; Stock et al . , 2007 ) , detect hyperphosphorylated ( II0 ) RPB1 in untransfected NIH-3T3 , wild-type 8K and 0K mutant cells , showing that mutation of K7-to-S7 residues is compatible with normal global levels of serine phosphorylation . To examine the effect of K7-to-S7 mutation on the subcellular localization of RPB1 , we used confocal microscopy and YFP fluorescence to detect YFP-RPB1 fusion proteins and found that the typical RNAPII nucleoplasmic distribution is unaffected by K7-to-S7 mutations ( Figure 2c; e . g . Xie et al . , 2006 ) . Immunofluorescence using S5p antibodies also shows similar distribution and levels of S5p in 8K and 0K cells ( Figure 2c ) . These observations show that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts , and suggest that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues . Acetylation of CTD-K7 residues was recently identified and found associated with inducible gene expression ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . Lysine acetylation has been extensively studied in the context of histone proteins , where it is often counter-balanced by methylation , with clear roles in regulation of gene expression and repression ( Bannister and Kouzarides , 2011; Wozniak and Strahl , 2014 ) . To investigate whether K7 methylation could counteract K7 acetylation of RNAPII , we developed specific monoclonal antibodies using CTD peptides methylated on K7 . With the aim of raising antibodies that could potentially detect methylation in several or all of the K7-containing CTD repeats , we chose the peptide sequence centered on the K7 residue in repeat 35 of the CTD ( Figure 3a ) . This heptad has the most represented K7-repeat sequence ( YSPTSPK ) , and is the K7 residue with most conserved distance to the C-terminal end of RPB1 in vertebrates and invertebrates ( Figure 1b ) . Peptides modified by mono- , di- and tri-methylation of K7 residues were used for immunization . The supernatants of hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) to test for specificity to CTD-K7 methylation ( Figure 3b ) . We identified several antibody clones specific for CTD-K7 mono- or di-methylation ( Figure 3c ) . Clone CMA611 is specific for CTD-K7me1 and does not recognize unmodified CTD-K7 , CTD-K7me2 , CTD-K7me3 or CTD-K7ac . Clone CMA612 is specific for CTD-K7me2 and does not bind to the other peptides tested ( Figure 3c ) . Although ELISA analyses identified clones that recognize CTD-K7me3 , or both CTD-K7me3 and me1\/2 forms , these clones showed reactivity towards other proteins ( not shown ) . We therefore did not perform further analyses using CTD-K7me3 antibody clones . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 006Figure 3 . RPB1 is mono- and di-methylated at CTD-K7 residues . ( a ) Amino-acid sequence of CTD-K7-methyl peptides used for immunization , designed based on the sequence of mouse CTD repeats 35 and 36 . ( b ) Schematic representation of strategy used for production and screening of specific CTD-K7-methyl antibodies . Antibody clones that specifically recognize K7 or its modifications should bind strongly to the wild-type band , the 8K slower-migrating band , but not to the mutant 0K band . ( c ) Specificity of CTD-K7 methyl antibodies was assessed by ELISA using unmodified ( K7 ) , mono- ( K7me1 ) , di- ( K7me2 ) , tri-methylated ( K7me3 ) and acetylated ( K7ac ) CTD peptides ( Table 1 ) . Clones CMA611 and CMA612 are specific for K7me1 and K7me2 , respectively . ( d ) K7me1 and K7me2 mark hypophosphorylated RPB1 in mouse cells with migration similar to forms detected using 8WG16 antibody . Western blotting was performed using total protein extracts from NIH-3T3 ( 3T3 ) , and from NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing wild-type 8K ( 8K ) or mutant 0K ( 0K ) . K7me1 and K7me2 are detected in 3T3 and 8K , but not in 0K cell lines . CTD methylation migrates at the level of hypophosphorylated RNAPII ( IIa and Y-IIa ) . Low levels of methylation of endogenous RPB1 is also detected in 8K and 0K cell lines , due to expression from endogenous Rpb1 locus . \u03b1-Tubulin was used as loading control .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 007 To test whether mono- or di-methylation of the CTD could be identified in vivo , we performed western blotting on total extracts from NIH-3T3 , 8K and 0K cell lines using the novel antibodies against CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 ( Figure 3d , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . K7me1 and K7me2 are detected in NIH-3T3 and in 8K cell lines , both of which express a CTD with eight K7 residues , but not in the 0K mutant cell line , where all K7 residues are mutated to S7 . These results confirm the specificity of the K7me1 and K7me2 antibodies to CTD-K7 modifications . The single band in NIH-3T3 and in 8K cell lines shows lack of cross-reactivity to other NIH-3T3 proteins ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . These results demonstrate the existence of in vivo methylation of non-canonical K7 residues of the CTD in mouse fibroblasts . RPB1 migrates in two major forms , a fast migrating hypophosphorylated ( IIa ) state and a slower migrating hyperphosphorylated ( II0 ) state , as well as intermediate phosphorylation forms . Interestingly , we found that both the K7me1 and K7me2 antibodies detect the hypophosphorylated RPB1 and YFP-RPB1 bands ( Figure 3d ) . This band is also detected by the antibody 8WG16 , which preferentially recognizes unmodified S2 residues ( reviewed inBrookes and Pombo , 2009 ) . To confirm the presence of K7me1 and K7me2 within hypophosphorylated RPB1 , we repeated the K7me1 and K7me2 western blotting in mouse ES cells , confirming immunoreactivity to hypophosphorylated RPB1 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . To explore the extent of methylation of the eight mammalian K7 residues , we performed western blots using the NIH-3T3 cell lines engineered to express YFP-RPB1 fusion proteins bearing different numbers of K7 residues ( 0 , 1 , 3 or 8 lysines; Figure 3e , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . Mono- and di-methylation were identified in total cell extracts from the 1K cell line . The intensities of mono- and di-methylation increase in the 3K line , indicating that several lysine residues are mono- and di-methylated in the same CTD . The level of mono-methylation increases further in the 8K-cell line , showing abundant mono-methylation of the CTD in vivo . In contrast , the di-methylation levels remain similar between the 8K and 3K lines , suggesting that not all eight CTD lysine-7 residues are simultaneously di-methylated , and reflecting a possible preference for di-methylation of the K residues conserved between mammals and invertebrates , which are present in the 3K construct . Similar expression levels of YFP-RPB1 were confirmed in the four cell lines using western blots for YFP and 8WG16 ( Figure 3e ) . We next tested whether CTD-K7 methylation is conserved across species . K7me2 is also detected in whole protein extracts from adult Caenorhabditis elegans worm , Drosophila melanogaster embryos , and human HEK293 cells , in western blotting analysis ( Figure 3f , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1d ) . These observations reveal , for the first time , conservation of a non-consensus CTD modification between vertebrates and invertebrates . K7me1 also occurs in human cells and C . elegans , but is not easily detected in extracts from D . melanogaster embryos , suggesting that di-methylation may be a more prevalent methylation mark . Detection of mono- and di-methylation at the single C . elegans K7 residue , with antibodies produced using peptides based on the mammalian repeats 34-\u201335 , also suggests that the recognition of K7 methylation is in general robust to small differences in the amino-acid sequences that flank the modified K7 residues ( compare C . elegans sequence , -S4-S5-P6-K7-Y1-S2-P3- , with immunizing mammalian peptide sequence , -T4-S5-P6-K7-Y1-T2-P3-; Figure 1a , b ) . This conclusion is also supported by the increased detection of K7me1 and K7me2 with increased number of K7 residues in the mammalian CTD ( cell lines 1K , 3K and 8K; Figure 3e ) , each flanked by slightly different amino acids ( Figure 1a ) . The observation that mono- and di-methylation of CTD-K7 residues is detected primarily in the hypophosphorylated ( faster-migrating ) forms of RPB1 ( Figure 3d ) suggests that CTD methylation is associated with early stages of the transcription cycle . However , it could also result from steric hindrance of K7me1 and K7me2 antibody binding by CTD phosphorylation . To test whether CTD phosphorylation interferes with immunodetection of K7 methylation , we performed western blots from total protein extracts obtained from mouse ES cells , and pre-treated the blots with alkaline phosphatase to remove phosphoepitopes prior to immunoblotting ( Figure 4a , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . We find that the detection of K7 methylation remains specific to the hypophosphorylated RPB1 after treatment of immunoblots with alkaline phosphatase , showing only a minor increase in the detection of K7me1 and K7me2 at intermediately phosphorylated forms , in conditions that fully abrogate detection of phosphorylated epitopes ( e . g . S5p; see also Stock et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , immunodetection of K7me1 and K7me2 is only minimally affected by CTD phosphorylation , suggesting that K7me1 and K7me2 modifications are depleted from elongation-competent hyperphosphorylated RPB1 complexes . Interestingly , the association of K7me1 and K7me2 with hypophosphorylated form of RPB1 differs from K7ac , previously shown to occur at both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated RPB1 forms ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that K7 methylation may precede K7 acetylation during the transcription cycle . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 008Figure 4 . Interplay between K7me1 and K7me2 with RPB1 phosphorylation . ( a ) CTD K7me1 and K7me2 mark hypophosphorylated and intermediately phosphorylated Rpb1 forms , but not the hyperphosphorylated ( II0 ) form .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 009 To further investigate whether K7 mono- and di-methylation occur upstream of elongation , we treated ES cells with flavopiridol , an inhibitor of RNAPII elongation ( Chao and Price , 2001 ) . Depletion of elongation-competent complexes can be achieved by short treatment of ES cells with flavopiridol ( 10 \u00b5M , 1\u00a0hr ) , as shown by loss of S2p detection and lower mobility of S5p forms in western blots ( Stock et al . , 2007; Figure 4b , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . We find that K7me1 and K7me2 levels are only minimally increased by flavopiridol treatment ( Figure 4b ) , consistent with both modifications being associated with pre-elongation stages of transcription . The minor increase in K7me1 and K7me2 levels agrees with the slightly increased detection of K7 methylation upon CTD dephosphorylation . We then tested whether K7me1 and K7me2 are localized within the nucleus using immunofluorescence in mouse NIH-3T3 cells ( Figure 4c ) . We find K7me1 and K7me2 concentrated in punctate nucleoplasmic domains , absent from nucleoli and regions of heterochromatin . The K7me1 and K7me2 foci are sparser than the discrete nucleoplasmic domains containing total YFP-RPB1 or S5p ( see Figure 2c ) , consistent with their presence at RNAPII complexes involved in more restricted transcription events , rather than extensively marking chromatin-free RPB1 . To explore the role of K7me1 and K7me2 in the transcription cycle , we mapped their chromatin occupancy genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to next generation sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) in mouse ES cells ( Figure 5 ) . The chromatin occupancy of K7me1 and K7me2 was compared with RNAPII phosphorylation ( S5p , S7p , S2p and unmodified S2 detected with antibody 8WG16 ) , with K7 acetylation , and with mRNA-seq , using published datasets from mouse ES cells ( Figure 5a; Brookes et al . , 2012; Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . S5p , S7p and 8WG16 are primarily enriched at gene promoters and downstream of polyadenylation sites; S2p is detected along gene bodies and is most highly enriched immediately after polyadenylation sites ( Brookes et al . , 2012 ) . CTD-K7ac occupies gene promoters and extends into gene bodies , as previously described ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 010Figure 5 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 012 Inspection of ChIP-seq profiles at single genes shows that K7me1 and K7me2 are highly enriched at promoters of active genes ( Eed , Rpl13 , and Tuba1a ) , and are detected at lower levels beyond transcription end sites ( Figure 5a ) . K7ac is also found at gene promoters but is often present downstream of K7 methylation occupancy , within gene bodies . K7 methylation and acetylation , and other RNAPII modifications , are not detected at inactive genes ( e . g . Myf5 gene ) . K7me1 and K7me2 occupancy at active genes , and absence at inactive , were confirmed by single gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . In summary , we find that K7me1 and K7me2 are more tightly localized to gene promoters than K7ac , suggesting association with the earliest stages of transcription . Given that K7me1 , K7me2 and K7ac exhibit different occupancy patterns at active genes , we assessed the genome-wide promoter distribution and abundance of each mark . We first identified all genomic regions positive for CTD-K7 marks , using a peak finder suited for both sharp and broader occupancy patterns ( Bayesian change-point , BCP; Xing et al . , 2012 ) . We then used these positive regions to classify gene promoters according to the presence of each modification ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . A total of 6962 , 8265 and 8312 gene promoters were classified as positive for K7me1 , K7me2 and K7ac , respectively . The vast majority of these genes are ( i ) positive for all three marks ( n\u00a0=\u00a06398; Figure 5b ) , ( ii ) also marked by S5p , S7p , S2p and 8WG16 ( Figure 5c ) , and ( iii ) transcriptionally active at the messenger\u00a0RNA ( mRNA ) level ( Figure 5d ) . As a further test of the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 presence at productive RNAPII complexes , we evaluated their presence at polycomb\u00a0repressed ( PRCr ) genes . This group of genes is associated with poised RNAPII complexes in mouse ES cells , which are characterized by an unusual CTD state phosphorylated at S5 but not at S7 or S2 , and that does not lead to mRNA expression ( Brookes et al . , 2012; Stock et al . , 2007; Tee et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 to expressed genes , we found that K7me1 and K7me2 do not mark poised RNAPII at PRCr genes marked by H3K27me3 and H2Aub1 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2a and 2b ) and that they are associated with promoters marked by H3K4me3 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2c ) . To ascertain the distribution of the different CTD modifications at active genes , we plotted average occupancy profiles around transcription start sites ( TSS ) and transcription end sites ( TES ) of the 15% most and least expressed genes ( Figure 5e ) . The novel CTD modifications K7me1 and K7me2 are sharply enriched at the TSS . These profiles are very similar to that of S7p while , in contrast , K7ac is more broadly localized up- and downstream of the TSS . Together with the observations that K7me1 and K7me2 mark hypophosphorylated RPB1 and that their abundance is insensitive to inhibition of RNAPII elongation ( Figure 4a , b ) , their specific enrichment at the promoters of active genes suggests that they mark the earliest stages of the transcription cycle at protein coding genes . To explore the temporal sequence of CTD modifications during the transcription cycle and how they predict gene expression levels , we performed extensive correlation analyses between different RNAPII modifications ( Figure 6 ) . We focused on active genes using a refined group of genes which are ( i ) positive for S5p , S7p and S2p , ( ii ) expressed at the mRNA level , and ( iii ) negative for the repressive histone modifications H3K27me3 and H2Aub1 . We also excluded overlapping genes and genes where the maximum peak of RNAPII ( marked by unphosphorylated RNAPII using 8WG16 antibody ) is not within 50 bp of the annotated TSS , yielding a group of 1564 active genes . We find that mRNA levels are most strongly correlated with S2p levels at TES of active genes ( Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient 0 . 62 ) , followed by promoter K7ac ( 0 . 55 ) and S7p ( 0 . 49; Figure 6a ) . In contrast , the enrichment levels of K7me1 and K7me2 at gene promoters ( which are highly self-correlated , 0 . 93 ) poorly correlate with S2p or mRNA ( 0 . 31\u20130 . 45 ) , but highly correlate with modifications associated with initiation and early elongation ( unphosphorylated RNAPII , S5p and S7p; 0 . 72\u20130 . 86 ) . These correlations suggest that CTD-K7 methylation is related to RNAPII occupancy at gene promoters , and not directly to elongating complexes . Similar results are obtained with a more inclusive correlation analysis using the full list of non-overlapping active genes irrespective of 8WG16 peak distance to TSS ( n\u00a0=\u00a04271 ) , and including histone modifications and CpG content ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 013Figure 6 .

This correlation analysis was performed with the group of active genes ( n\u00a0=\u00a01564 ) positive for S5p , S7p and S2p , with expression level of FPKM\u00a0>1 , and negative for H3K27me3 and H2Aub1 , also excluding overlapping genes and genes whose maximum RNAPII peak ( 8WG16 ) is >50\u00a0bp away from the annotated TSS .

Surprisingly , we found that the partial correlation between K7me2 and S2p becomes zero after removing individual contributions of S5p or K7ac; similar results were obtained for K7me1 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . Moreover , removing the contribution of S7p alone , or the combined contributions of S7p , S5p and K7ac , results in small negative correlations of K7me2 ( and K7me1 ) with S2p ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . These results suggest that K7me1 and K7me2 are anti-correlated with S2p , which in turn is highly correlated with K7ac . We also performed partial correlation analyses to test the individual contributions of S7p and K7ac to productive elongation after adjusting for the effects of their correlation with each other . Both marks maintain positive partial correlations with S2p levels ( 0 . 29 and 0 . 25 respectively; Figure 6c ) , suggesting that both S7p and K7ac have direct links to the extent of elongation . In these pairwise correlation analyses , we began to dissect unexpected dependencies between different CTD modifications and how they relate to productive elongation . However , the most likely scenario is that several CTD modifications jointly contribute to expression levels . To further explore whether CTD modifications work together to promote productive transcription , we employed stepwise regression models to determine the CTD modifications that best predict elongation marked by S2p levels , for a given number of predictors ( Figure 6d ) . These analyses confirm that S7p and K7ac are ( i ) the best predictors of S2p in single-variable models , ( ii ) the top combination of modifications in two-variable models , and ( iii ) always present in the top models when considering three , four and five modifications . Surprisingly , we also find that the promoter levels of K7me1 and K7me2 have significant negative contributions to the S2p elongation mark and mRNA expression , when considered together with the positively correlated variables S5p , S7p and\/or K7ac . The dependencies identified were further tested using LASSO regression , which is more robust to artifacts ( due to co-linearity in the predictors and over-fitting ) , in combination with a common cross-validation approach ( minimum error plus one standard error criterion ) to select the most parsimonious linear model in the LASSO path ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We confirmed major positive contributions of S7p and K7ac to the levels of S2p ( and mRNA ) , together with smaller ( non-redundant ) positive contribution of S5p , and negative contribution of K7me1 . LASSO regression also shows that the levels of K7me1 and K7me2 are redundant , as K7me2 has a similar negative contribution to the minimal linear model found by LASSO analysis , when K7me1 is excluded from the variable set ( not shown ) . Taken together , these results reinforce the observation that K7me1 and K7me2 are early transcription marks that are present at actively transcribed genes , but have negative contribution to mRNA levels , and raise the possibility that a balance between K7 methylation and K7 acetylation might define the extent of productive elongation at active genes . To investigate whether the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters could be predictive of gene expression , we calculated the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac and investigated how it relates to mature and nascent RNA levels . We find that the K7me2\/K7ac ratio negatively correlates with mRNA expression ( Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient -0 . 35; Figure 7a , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . Analyses of nascent transcription using published GRO-seq ( global\u00a0run-on sequencing ) data ( Jonkers et al . , 2014 ) yield a similar negative correlation with coefficient \u20130 . 31 ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 016Figure 7 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 020 To visualize the effect of the ratio between K7 methylation and acetylation on promoter occupancy and expression of single genes , we generated ChIP-seq heatmaps centered on active promoters after ordering genes according to their K7me2\/K7ac ratio and dividing them in three groups ( low , medium and high ratio; Figure 7b ) . We observe that unmodified S2 , marked by 8WG16 , shows a major peak centered on the TSS , as well as a secondary peak 140 bp downstream , and is independent of the K7me2\/K7ac ratio ( Figure 7c; see also Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2a for the full list of non-overlapping active genes ) . K7me1 and K7me2 are enriched at the TSS-centered peak , but not at the secondary 8WG16 peak +140 bp downstream of the TSS ( Figure 7c ) , which has previously been associated with promoter-proximal pausing ( Quinodoz et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , K7ac expands downstream of the TSS up to +500\u00a0bp , especially at genes with low K7me2\/K7ac ratios , but without specific enrichment at the secondary 8WG16 peak . S2p , which is a broad elongation mark enriched mostly at the TES , does not peak at the TSS . Interestingly , genes with the highest K7me2\/K7ac ratios exhibit the lowest mRNA or nascent transcript expression ( Figure 7c and 7d ) , and lowest S2p in the beginning of gene bodies ( Figure 7c ) and after TES ( Figure 7d ) . Inspection of single gene profiles confirms these general observations ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2b ) . To explore the functionality of genes associated with higher or lower K7me\/K7ac ratios , we performed Gene Ontology ( GO ) analyses ( Figure 7e ) . Interestingly , we found that genes with high K7me2\/K7ac ratios are associated with GO terms that relate with negative regulation of translation , and kinase cascades , such as positive regulation of peptidyl-serine phosphorylation , of Rab GTPase activity and of JUN kinase activity . In contrast , genes with low K7me2\/K7ac ratios are associated with GO terms that relate with housekeeping functions in mouse ES cells such as translation , DNA-dependent transcription , carbohydrate utilization and regulation of developmental process . These results suggest that the balance between K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters is important to define the extent of productive transcription at groups of genes with different biological functions , namely in the transition between initiation and elongation , which can contribute to fine-tuning gene expression levels . Previous work reported transcriptional up-regulation of gene expression upon treatment of ES\u00a0cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A ( TSA; Karantzali et al . , 2008 ) , which has also been shown to induce global increase in CTD-K7acetylation ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . To test whether the genes with highest K7me2\/K7ac ratios are more sensitive to up-regulation upon TSA treatment , we mined published microarray data from mouse ES\u00a0cells treated with TSA ( Karantzali et al . , 2008 ) . We find that TSA has different effects on the three groups of genes according to their K7me2\/K7ac ratio ( Figure 7f ) . The genes with high K7me2\/K7ac ratio are more likely to be upregulated ( 107\/141 genes ) upon TSA treatment , than downregulated ( 34\/141 genes ) . Genes in the medium ratio group are equally likely to be upregulated ( 51\/91 genes ) or downregulated ( 40\/91 genes ) . Finally , genes with the lowest ratio are most often downregulated ( 142\/180 genes ) than upregulated ( 38\/180 genes ) . The effect of TSA on three groups of genes is significantly different ( Fisher\u2019s exact test; high versus low ratio: p\u00a0<\u00a02 . 2x10\u201316 ) . We observed a similar trend when we treated our ES cell line with TSA; genes with higher ratios tend to be upregulated ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . To test the converse effect of K7ac depletion on the levels of K7me , we treated cells with P300 inhibitor C646 , which was previously shown to deplete K7ac levels ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . We find that inhibition of P300 induces an average 1 . 7-fold increase in the global levels of K7me2 ( ranging from 1 . 2 to 2 . 5-fold across replicates ) , whereas the levels of total RPB1 remain constant or are slightly increased ( Figure 7g ) . Levels of S7p also remain constant after P300 inhibition with C646 suggesting that K7ac and S7p contribute independently to productive elongation ( Figure 7g ) , an observation which is consistent with the non-redundant contributions of K7ac and S7p to S2p and mRNA levels found by partial correlation and stepwise regression analyses ( Figure 6 ) . Taken together , our results suggest that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters , is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications , with methylation being associated with less productive transcription , and K7 acetylation being most enriched at the highest expressed genes . \n The expansion of the RPB1 CTD in repeat number and amino\u00a0acid diversity has been associated with increased complexity in specific groups of organisms , including vertebrates and plants ( Corden , 2013; Yang and Stiller , 2014 ) . Larger CTDs are thought to accommodate larger protein complexes . Non-canonical CTD repeats have the potential to expand the diversity of post-translational modifications , resulting in more complex signaling through the CTD . Although there is increasing recognition that complex CTDs may have specific roles in the regulation of more complex developmental programs , gene structures or gene organization ( Litingtung et al . , 1999; Liu et al . , 2010; Simonti et al . , 2015 ) , our understanding of CTD signaling remains extremely limited , particularly as we have not yet identified all CTD modifications . A small number of modifications to non-canonical residues have been identified , and their importance for the expression of specific subgroups of genes revealed . In mammalian cells , methylation of a single CTD-R7 is involved in expression of snRNAs and snoRNAs ( Sims et al . , 2011 ) . Acetylation of CTD-K7 residues , the most common non-canonical substitution , has been associated with inducible gene expression of EGF-regulated genes ( Schroeder et al . , 2013 ) . In the present study , we show that CTD-K7 residues are mono- and di-methylated in mouse and human cells , and in the invertebrates C . elegans and D . melanogaster . Using murine cell lines with K7-to-S7 substitutions , we show that several CTD-K7 residues are simultaneously mono- and di-methylated , including a single K7 residue at repeat 35 of the murine CTD . Conservation of CTD-K7 methylation , and expansion of the number of methylated CTD-K7 residues from invertebrates to mammals , suggests functional relevance of this modification across taxa . Model systems characterized by K7 expansion ( e . g . Plasmodium parasites; Kishore et al . , 2009 ) further support the need for studying the extent of K7 modifications at RNAPII CTD . We demonstrate that CTD-K7 mono- and di-methylation are associated with the earliest stages of transcription , are refractory to CDK9 inhibition using flavopiridol , and are distributed in discrete foci in the nucleoplasm of single cells . We mapped the genome-wide occupancy of K7me1 and K7me2 in mouse ES\u00a0cells and find that they are highly enriched at the promoters of active genes . CTD-K7 methylation levels are highly correlated with promoter levels of unmodified S2 , S7p , and S5p , but are uncoupled from mRNA expression and S2p abundance . In contrast , we find that CTD-K7 acetylation expands downstream of promoter regions into gene bodies , and highly correlates with S2p and mRNA levels . One interesting aspect that emerges from studying CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation is that the two marks may compete for the eight available K7 residues at the CTD and thereby regulate gene expression levels . We observed that the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac at active promoters is inversely related to gene expression . Genes with similar promoter occupancy of RNAPII but which have higher levels of K7me2 relative to K7ac are significantly less expressed than genes that have higher levels of K7ac relative to K7me2 . This suggests that a balance between K7 modifications fine-tunes gene expression levels . Further studies are required to explore the enzymatic activities that methylate and demethylate CTD-K7 residues , as well as the readers of methylated CTD-K7 . We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of proteins associated with YFP-tagged RPB1 containing the wild-type CTD or the CTD bearing all K7-to-S7 mutations , followed by mass spectrometry , but this strategy failed to identify specific modifiers and readers ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the interactions of RNAPII with CTD-K7 modifiers and\/or readers may be transient and not easily captured by in\u00a0vitro biochemical approaches . The identification of modified CTD-K7 residues ( K7me1 , K7me2 , K7me3 and K7ac ) expands the repertoire of CTD interactors to proteins containing domains that recognize these marks , such as PHD finger , bromo- , chromo- , tudor- and MBT-domains ( Biggar and Li , 2015; Hamamoto et al . , 2015 ) . Cross-talk between K7 modification and other CTD modifications , such as phosphorylation , may also regulate the extent of factor recruitment . Future investigations of the CTD code should consider the contribution of K7 modifications to co-transcriptional gene regulation in development and disease . \n Mouse ES cell line OS25 ( generated in the laboratory of Austin G . Smith , and kindly donated by Wendy Bickmore ) was grown on 0 . 1% gelatin-coated surfaces in GMEM-BHK21 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 1% MEM non-essential amino acids , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 50 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol ( all from Gibco , Invitrogen;\u00a0Waltham , MA ) , 1000 U\/ml of human recombinant leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF; Chemicon , Millipore;\u00a0Germany ) and 0 . 1 mg\/ml Hygromycin ( Roche;\u00a0Switzerland ) , as described previously ( Billon et al . , 2002; Niwa et al . , 2000 ) . For inhibition of CDK9 activity and S2 phosphorylation , ES cells were treated for 1\u00a0hr with 10 \u00b5M of flavopiridol prior to protein extraction ( Stock et al . , 2007 ) ; from 50 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ; a kind gift from Sanofi-Aventis , provided by Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch , Developmental Therapeutics Program , Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD . For general deacetylase inhibition , ES cells were treated with TSA ( 50 nM , 3\u00a0hr ) ; western blotting for H3K9ac confirmed efficient deacetylase inhibition ( not shown ) . For inhibition of P300 acetylase , ES cells were treated ( 3h ) with 30 \u00b5M C646 ( Sigma , # SML0002;\u00a0Germany ) inhibitor , prior to protein extractions . For flavopiridol , TSA and C646 treatments , control cells were treated with vehicle ( DMSO ) . NIH-3T3 cells ( kind donation from Alex Sardini ) were grown in Dulbecco's modi\ufb01ed Eagle's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( all from Gibco , Invitrogen ) . NIH-3T3 derived cell lines 8K , 3K , 1K and 0K were grown in presence of \u03b1-amanitin selection ( 2 \u00b5g\/ml; Sigma ) . Mouse ES cell line ( OS25 ) and mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblast line were negative for mycoplasma , and routinely tested for mycoplasma with PCR mycoplasma test kit ( AppliChem;\u00a0Germany ) , according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions . The RPB1 construct YFP-Rpb1 amr contains a point mutation that gives resistance to \u03b1-amanitin ( kind gift from Xavier Darzacq; Darzacq et al . , 2007 ) . The construct was digested with SanDI and HpaI ( Thermo Fisher Scientific;\u00a0Waltham , MA ) to remove a fragment with 1 . 3 kb ( residues 6126 to 7428 ) containing the Rpb1 CTD . Different CTD sequences with wild-type ( 8K ) and mutant repeats ( 3K , 1K and 0K ) were obtained by gene synthesis ( Genscript;\u00a0Piscataway , NJ ) in the pUC57 vector backbone . In the mutant constructs , the K7 residues were converted into the consensus S7 residues . Mutant 3K contains only three of the K7 residues present at repeats 35 , 40 and 47 , mutant 1K contains only one K7 residue present at repeat 35 and mutant 0K has all K7 residues mutated to S7 . Wild-type and mutant CTDs were cloned from the pUC57 vectors to the YFP-Rpb1 amr backbone using the SanDI and HpaI restriction sites . Constructs were digested and sequenced to confirm the presence of the eight K7 codons at the wild-type construct , the K7 to S7 mutations at the different mutant contructs and the absence of additional sequence changes . For generation of cell lines 8K , 3K , 1K and 0K , NIH-3T3 cells growing in a 6-well dish were transfected with 3 \u00b5g of DNA using lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , # 11668 ) . \u03b1-Amanitin selection ( 2 \u00b5g\/ml , Sigma ) was started 24\u00a0hr after transfection . Polyclonal cell lines were kept under selection and expanded for 1 month before being used in the experiments described . All handling of mice was approved by the Hokkaido University Animal Experiment Committee ( approval number: 11-0109 ) and carried out according to guidelines for animal experimentation at Hokkaido University , where MAB Institute is located . Animals were housed in a designated pathogen-free facility at Hokkaido University . Mice were humanely euthanized via cervical dislocation by technically proficient individuals . Mouse monoclonal antibodies were produced essentially as described previously ( Kimura et al . , 2008 ) . Briefly , to generate monoclonal antibodies specific for CTD-K7me1 , me2 and me3 , mice were immunized with synthetic peptides ( Figure 3a ) that were conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin . Hybridoma clones were generated and screened by ELISA using 96-well microtiter plates that were coated with the synthetic peptides ( Table 1 ) conjugated with bovine serum albumin . Microtiter plates were incubated with 3-fold dilutions of each antibody starting from 1:20 dilution of a hybridoma culture supernatant , washed with phosphate-buffered\u00a0saline ( PBS ) , incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody , and washed with PBS , before the colorimetric detection ( 450 nm absorbance ) using tetramethylbenzidine . ELISA-positive clones were further validated using western blotting to attest their RNAPII specificity . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11215 . 021Table 1 . RPB1 CTD peptides .

Hybridoma clones CMA611 and CMA612 used in this study were specific for K7me1 and K7me2 peptides , respectively . Prior to purification , CMA611 and CMA612 antibody clones were isotyped as IgG2b-\u03ba and IgG1-\u03ba , respectively , using a Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Kit ( AbD Serotec , #MMT1;\u00a0Hercules , CA ) . Clones were expanded in CD Hybridoma medium ( Life Technologies ) and culture supernatant was collected ( for CMA612 clone NaCl was added to a final concentration of 4M ) , filtered using a 0 . 45 \u03bcm membrane ( Nalgene;\u00a0Rochester , NY ) and purified using HiTrap Protein A FF Sepharose columns ( 1 ml; GE Healthcare;\u00a0UK ) . Elution of CMA611 clone was performed using elution buffer ( 0 . 1 M glycine-HCl , pH 2 . 8 ) . Elution of CMA612 clone was performed using mouse IgG1 mild elution buffer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Antibody elution fractions were concentrated and the buffer was replaced to PBS using centrifugal filtration with Amicon Ultra filter 50K ( Millipore ) . Whole cell extracts were collected by scraping cells in ice-cold 'lysis' buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 10% glycerol , 50 mM NaF , 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1% Triton X-100 ( all from Sigma ) , 1 mM DTT ( Invitrogen ) , supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors Na3VO4 ( 2 mM ) and PMSF ( 1 mM , Sigma ) and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Complete Mini EDTA-free , Roche # 11836170001 ) ] . To release chromatin-associated proteins , cell extracts were sheared by passage through a 25G needle , as in Stock et al . , 2007 . Protein content of cell extracts was quantified using either Bradford ( Bio-Rad , # 500-0205 ) or Bio-Rad DC protein assay ( Bio-Rad , #500-0116 ) . The following amounts of total extracts were used for western blotting: 0 . 5\u20132 \u00b5g total protein for 4H8 ( S5p ) and 8WG16 ( unmodified-S2 ) antibodies , and 5\u201310 \u00b5g total protein for the other RNAPII antibodies\/modifications and 20 \u00b5g for histone H3K9 acetylation . Protein extracts were resolved on 3%\u20138% Tris-acetate sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) gels ( Novex , Life Technologies;\u00a0Waltham , MA ) for RNAPII modifications and 15% SDS-PAGE gels for histone H3K9 acetylation . Membranes were blocked , incubated for primary antibody , washed and incubated for secondary antibody all in blocking buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween-20 , 5% non-fat dry milk; all from Sigma ) .

To remove phospho-epitopes from blots after protein transfer , membranes were treated with Alkaline Phosphatase Calf Intestinal ( 1 U\/\u00b5l;\u00a0NEB , #M0290S; Ipswich , MA ) for 8 hr at 37\u00b0C in NEB buffer 3 , prior to western blotting; control untreated blots were incubated with NEB buffer 3 . C . elegans whole worm extracts ( kind donation from Stefanie Seelk and Baris Tursun ) were prepared from N2 worms ( wild-type ) . Worms were washed in M9 medium ( 42 mM Na2HPO4 , 22 mM KH2PO4 , 86 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgSO4 ) and directly lysed in SDS sample buffer for 10 min at 94\u00b0C . Nuclei from D . melanogaster embryos ( kind donation from Robert Zinzen ) were isolated as previously described in Bonn et al . ( 2012 ) . Protein extracts were obtained using 'lysis' buffer as described above . Mouse fibroblasts ( NIH-3T3 cell line ) were grown on coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine ( Sigma ) . Cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 in 125 mM HEPES-NaOH ( pH 7 . 6 ) and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature . After permeabilization , coverslips were washed in PBS and incubated with 20 mM glycine ( Sigma ) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Blocking ( 1\u00a0hr ) , incubation with primary ( 2\u00a0hr ) and secondary ( 1\u00a0hr ) antibodies was performed in 'PBS plus' ( PBS supplemented with 1% casein , 1% BSA , 0 . 2% fish skin gelatin , pH 7 . 8 , all from Sigma ) . Washes were done using 'PBS plus' ( after primary and secondary antibody incubations ) . Prior to nuclei acid staining , coverslips were washed with 0 . 1% Tween-20 in PBS . Nucleic acids were stained using 2 \u00b5M TOTO-3 iodide ( Invitrogen ) in 0 . 1% Tween-20 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature . Coverslips were mounted in VectaShield ( Vector Laboratories , UK ) and imaging was performed using a laser scanning confocal microscope Leica TCS SP2 . ChIP for RNAPII modifications was performed using fixed chromatin as described previously ( Brookes et al . , 2012; Stock et al . , 2007 ) . Mouse ES cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde ( Sigma ) at 37\u00b0C for 10 min after which the reaction was stopped adding glycine to a final concentration of 0 . 125M . Fixed cells were washed with ice cold PBS , lysed in 'swelling buffer' [25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM KCl ( all from Sigma ) and 0 . 1% NP-40 ( Roche ) ] , scraped from dishes and nuclei were isolated with a Dounce homogenizer ( tight pestle ) followed by centrifugation . Nuclei resuspended ( 1x107 nuclei\/ml ) in 'sonication' buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1% Triton X-100 , 0 . 1% Na-deoxycholate and 0 . 1% SDS ( all from Sigma ) ] were sonicated ( Diagenode Bioruptor ) for 30 min at full power for 30 cycles of 30 s \"on\" and 30 s \"off\" at 4\u00b0C . Chromatin was centrifuged and , after disposal of the insoluble fraction , DNA content was quantified using alkaline lysis . Both swelling and sonication buffers were supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors sodium\u00a0flouride ( 5 mM ) , Na3VO4 ( 2 mM ) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF; 1 mM ) and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Complete Mini EDTA-free , Roche # 11836170001 ) . Protein G magnetic beads ( Active Motif;\u00a0Carlsbad , CA ) were incubated ( 50 \u00b5l per IP ) with 10 \u00b5g of bridging antibody anti-IgM\/IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C and then washed and resuspended in sonication buffer . For each immunoprecipitation , 600\u2013700 \u00b5g of chromatin was incubated overnight with beads and the respective RNAPII or control antibody ( for details about ChIP antibodies see Table 2 ) . After immunoprecipitation , beads were washed at 4\u00b0C as described previously ( Stock et al . , 2007 ) . For elution of the immune complexes , beads were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 1% SDS and incubated for 5 min at 65\u00b0C , followed by 15 min at room temperature . Reverse cross-linking was done at 65\u00b0C overnight ( for qPCR ) or for 8\u00a0hr ( for samples processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) library preparation ) after adding 10 \u00b5g of RNase A ( Sigma , #R4642 ) and NaCl to a final concentration of 155 mM . Samples were incubated with 100 \u00b5g of Proteinase K ( Roche , # 03115836001 ) , after EDTA concentration was adjusted to 5 mM , for 2h at 50\u00b0C . DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 ng\/ml glycogen . DNA concentration was determined by PicoGreen fluorimetric assay ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen;\u00a0Waltham , MA ) and samples were diluted to a final concentration of 0 . 2 ng\/\u00b5l . Immunoprecipitated and input samples ( 0 . 5 ng each ) were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) using SYBR No-Rox sensimix ( Bioline , UK ) . Quantitative PCR 'cycle over threshold' ( Ct ) values from immunoprecipitated samples ( RNAPII or control antibody ) were subtracted from the input Ct values and the fold enrichment over input was calculated using the equation 2 ( input Ct \u2013 IP Ct ) .

ChIP-seq libraries for CTD-K7me1 and K7me2 were prepared from 10 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA ( quantified by PicoGreen and Qubit ) using the Next ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set from Illumina ( NEB , # E6240 ) following the NEB protocol , with some modifications . The intermediate products from the different steps of the NEB protocol were purified using MiniElute PCR purification kit ( Qiagen , # 28004 , Germany ) . Adaptors , PCR amplification primers and indexing primers were from the Multiplexing Sample Preparation Oligonucleotide Kit ( Illumina , # PE-400\u20131001; San Diego , CA ) . Samples were PCR amplified prior to size selection ( 250\u2013600\u00a0bp ) on an agarose gel . After purification by QIAquick Gel Extraction kit ( Qiagen , # 28704 ) , libraries were quantified by qPCR using Kapa Library Quantification Universal Kit ( KapaBiosystems , #KK4824;\u00a0Wilmington , MA ) . Library size distribution was assessed by Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA analysis Kit ( Agilent , #5067\u20134626 , Santa Clara , CA ) before high-throughput sequencing . Libraries were quantified by Qubit and sequenced using Illumina Sequencing Technology ( single-end sequencing , 51 nucleotides ) at the BIMSB Genomics Platform using an Illumina HiSeq2000 , according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . In addition to ChIP-seq datasets generated for CTD-K7me1 and K7me2 modifications in mouse ES cells , we also analyzed published ES cell ChIP-seq and GRO-seq datasets ( Table 4 ) . Published RNAPII datasets were: unmodified-S2 ( detected with antibody 8WG16 ) , S5p , S7p , S2p , all from Brookes et al . , 2012 and RNAPII K7ac from Schroeder et al . , 2013 . Published histone modification datasets were: H2Aub1 and H3K36me3 from Brookes et al . , 2012; and H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 from Mikkelsen et al . , 2007 .

Sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse genome ( assembly mm9 , July 2007 ) using Bowtie2 version 2 . 0 . 5 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) , with default parameters . Duplicated reads ( i . e . identical reads , aligned to the same genomic location ) occurring more often than a threshold were removed . The threshold is computed for each dataset as the 95th percentile of the frequency distribution of reads . Boxplots were produced using R . A pseudo-count of 10\u20134 was added to FPKM values from Brookes et al . , 2012 prior to logarithmic transformation and plotting . Average ChIP-seq profiles were generated by plotting the average depth of coverage in non-overlapping windows of 10\u00a0bp , across 5\u00a0kb genomic windows centered on TSS and TES as in ( Brookes et al . , 2012 ) . The read coverage of ChIP-seq heatmaps was calculated using HTSeq ( Anders et al . , 2015 ) with 5\u00a0bp resolution . The z-score of each gene ( row ) was plotted using the pheatmap package ( Kolde , 2015 ) in R . GRO-seq data from Jonkers et al . , 2014 were downloaded as bedgraph files for untreated ES cells and the read coverage for sense and anti-sense transcription was calculated separately for a 1 . 5\u00a0kb window ( \u2013500 to +1000\u00a0bp of TSS ) at a 10\u00a0bp resolution . GRO-seq RPKM ( reads per kilobase per million of reads mapped ) values were estimated using the total number of reads mapped from the TSS to the TES of genes . For CTD-K7me1 , K7me2 and K7ac , positively enriched windows were detected using BCP ( Xing et al . , 2012 ) run in Histone Mark ( HM ) mode using as control datasets: ( a ) the mock ChIP dataset from Brookes et al . , 2012 for CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 , or ( b ) the input dataset from Schroeder et al . , 2013 for CTD-K7ac . Gene promoters were considered positive for K7me1 , K7me2 and K7ac when ( a ) the 2\u00a0kb windows centered on the gene promoters coincided with a region enriched for the mark and ( b ) the amount of reads in the promoter window was above the 10th percentile ( 10% tail cut; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . Genes whose ( positive ) TSS window overlapped other positive windows for the same mark were removed . Positive genes that were inside other positive genes for the same mark were also removed ( only \u2018internal\u2019 gene removed ) . Excluded genes were classified as NA . For other RNAPII modifications or histone marks , we used published classification from ( Brookes et al . , 2012 ) . For the analyses in Figure 7 and Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2a , we defined two cohorts of non-overlapping active genes . The larger group ( n\u00a0=\u00a04271 ) included all genes with non-overlapping promoters ( 2\u00a0kb window around TSS ) , active , i . e . FPKM >1 ( FPKM values from Brookes et al . , 2012 ) and positive for S5p ( TSS ) , S7p ( TSS ) , S2p ( 2\u00a0kb window after TES ) , as well as negative for the histone marks H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 . The smaller cohort ( n\u00a0=\u00a01564 ) had the additional criterion that the maximum peak of RNAPII ( 8WG16 ) has to be within a 100\u00a0bp window centered\u00a0at\u00a0the TSS . Genes classified as PRCr were positively marked by H3K27me3 , H2AK119ub1 and RNAPII-S5p , and negatively marked by 8WG16 , all at the 2\u00a0kb window centered around the genes TSS , and were devoid of RNAPII-S2p in the 2\u00a0kb window downstream of TES . They also do not overlap with other positively marked TSS or TES regions ( i . e . different from classification 'NA' in Brookes et al . , 2012 ) . Genes classified as most active ( top 15% ) or least active ( bottom 15% ) were defined according to FPKM values from mRNA-seq datasets published in ( Brookes et al . , 2012 ) , and were chosen from the pool of genes negative for Polycomb marks ( H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3; classification from Brookes et al . , 2012 ) . To relate CTD-K7 methylation to acetylation levels , we computed the ratio between the read counts of K7me1\/2 and K7ac at promoters ( 2\u00a0kb around TSS ) , both scaled by 10 million over the total number of non-duplicated mapped reads of the respective dataset . The ratios K7me1\/K7ac and K7me2\/K7ac are highly correlated ( Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient 0 . 88 ) ; for simplicity , only the K7me2\/K7ac ratio was used for further in-depth analyses . The ratio of K7me2\/K7ac for each active gene was used to define three quantiles ( high , medium and low K7me2\/K7ac ratio ) . To apply linear regression models and perform correlation analyses , the promoter read counts for the different CTD modifications were centered and scaled . The Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients were plotted as a matrix using the \"corrplot\" package in R and partial correlations calculated using the \"pcor\" function of \"ggm\" package . Traditional regression modeling using correlated predictor variables is difficult to interpret and hence we used a stepwise regression approach to better untangle the contributions of different CTD modifications . Typically , for a given number of predictor variables , we report the top five best models . Since CTD-S2p measured at 2\u00a0kb window after TES is the best predictor of mRNA amongst all CTD modifications and gene regions , we decided to study models that predict the levels of the S2p ( instead of mRNA-seq ) to avoid inclusion of another highly correlated variable . Model fitting was performed in R using the packages \"lm\" and \"leaps\" . Model ranking was based on both adjusted R2 and Mallow\u2019s Cp . To investigate whether the contribution of CTD modifications to S2p levels at 2\u00a0kb window after the TES , which were obtained through correlation and stepwise regression analyses , are due to co-linearity artifacts or over-fitting , we also employed the LASSO regression method implemented in the \"lars\" R package ( Efron , 2013 ) . We used as predictor variables the promoter levels of 8WG16 , S5p , S7p , K7me1 , K7me2 , K7ac , mock and CpG . A typical LASSO path is shown in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 . We used cross-validation [minimum cross-validated mean standard error + 1 standard error] to select the optimal position along the path; typical models discard the mock and 8WG16 predictors . As seen in stepwise regression , S7p and K7ac display significant positive coefficients while K7me1 and K7me2 have negative coefficients . Gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis was performed using GO-Elite version 1 . 2 . 5 ( Gladstone Institutes; http:\/\/genmapp . org\/go_elite ) . Over-representation analysis of the top and bottom 300 genes for K7me2\/K7ac ratio ( see above ) was performed using as background the n\u00a0=\u00a01564 active , non-overlapping genes for which the ratio was computed . Default parameters were used as filters: z-score threshold more than 1 . 96 , P-value less than 0 . 05 , number of genes changed more than 2 . Over-representation analysis was performed with \"permute p-value\" option , 2000 permutations . Total RNA transcriptomic analyses of 50 nM TSA treatment of mouse ES cells ( 6 hr ) is publicly available and described in Karantzali et al . , 2008 . Affimetrix Mouse430 2 . 0 Array probeset names were converted to Ensembl Gene ID using the \"Mouse430_2 . na34 . annot . csv\" table obtained from the Affymetrix website . Probesets associated with more than one Ensembl Gene ID were excluded from the analysis; in the few cases where more than one probeset was associated to the same Ensembl Gene ID , one probe set was randomly selected . Merging of the list of TSA differentially expressed genes with the K7me2\/K7ac ratio lists was performed using Ensembl Gene ID; genes in High , Medium or Low group were taken from extended cohort ( 4271 genes; see Bioinformatics analyses above ) . The significance of the difference between genes in the three ratio groups was tested with a two-tailed Fisher's exact test\u00a0using R . RNA was extracted by Trizol ( Ambion;\u00a0Waltham , MA ) extraction using Phase Lock Gel tubes ( 5 PRIME;\u00a0Gaithersburg , MD ) . Samples were DNAse I ( Turbo DNAse , Ambion ) treated according to manufacturer instructions . Total RNA ( 1 \u00b5g ) was retrotranscribed using random primers ( 50 ng ) and 200 U of reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript II RT , Invitrogen ) in a 20 \u00b5l reaction . The synthesized complementary\u00a0DNA was treated with 2 U of RNAse H ( NEB ) , diluted 1:10 and 2 . 5 \u00b5l were used per RT-PCR reaction . Total RNA was measured using primers designed for the 5\u00b4end of genes and levels were normalized for Actb mRNA measured using primers for the exon1-exon2 junction ( for primer sequence see Table 3 ) .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["chromosomes and gene expression","computational and systems biology"],"id":"elife-11215-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"An organism\u2019s DNA contains thousands of genes , not all of which are active at the same time . Cells use a number of methods to carefully control when particular genes are switched on or off . For example , proteins called transcription factors can activate a gene by binding to particular regions of DNA called promoters . One such transcription factor is called the TATA-binding protein ( TBP for short ) . Mot1 is a remodeling enzyme that can form a \u201ccomplex\u201d with TBP by binding to it , and in doing so remove TBP from DNA . This silences the genes at those sites . The freed TBP can then bind to other promoters that lack Mot1 and activate the genes found there . In 2011 , researchers revealed the structure of the complex formed between TBP and Mot1 after TBP has been detached from DNA . However , the structure of the complex that forms while TBP is still bound to the DNA molecule was not known . Butryn et al . \u2013 including several of the researchers involved in the 2011 work \u2013 have now described the structure of this complex using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy . Another protein called negative cofactor 2 is also part of the complex , and helps to stabilize it . Butryn et al . found that Mot1 reduces the strength of the interactions between DNA and both TBP and negative cofactor 2 . Binding to TBP and negative cofactor 2 causes the DNA molecule to bend; however , if Mot1 is also in the complex , the DNA becomes less bent . By making these changes , Mot1 is likely to prime TBP to detach from the DNA . Since the current structures do not yet reveal the atomic structure of Mot1\u2019s ATP dependent DNA motor domain , the next challenge is to visualize the entire complex at atomic resolution .","article":"Swi2\/Snf2 ATPases remodel substrates such as nucleosomes and transcription complexes to control a wide range of DNA-associated processes , but detailed structural information on the ATP-dependent remodeling reactions is largely absent . The single subunit remodeler Mot1 ( modifier of transcription 1 ) dissociates TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ) :DNA complexes , offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2\/Snf2 ATPases . Here , we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP , DNA , and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 ( NC2 ) . Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state , suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner . Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2\/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2 , thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers . This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2\/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex . \n Swi2\/Snf2 ( switch\/sucrose non-fermenting 2 ) ATPases form a large and diverse class of proteins and multiprotein assemblies within the SF2 superfamily of helicases\/translocases ( Flaus et al . , 2006 ) . Swi2\/Snf2 enzymes are best known as the principal catalytic subunits of large chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate the spatial arrangement and histone composition of nucleosomes , e . g . SWI\/SNF , ISWI , CHD , and INO80 remodelers ( Gangaraju and Bartholomew , 2007; Clapier and Cairns , 2009 ) . Current models propose that Swi2\/Snf2 ATPases track the minor groove of DNA , thereby generating tension that induces transient or permanent alterations in molecular assemblies ( Saha et al . , 2002; Whitehouse et al . , 2003; Zofall et al . , 2006 ) . Although high-resolution structures of some Swi2\/Snf2 domains and their substrate-interacting domains associated with DNA and protein have been previously described , detailed structural information about these ATPases bound to substrate proteins and DNA is largely absent ( D\u00fcrr et al . , 2005; Thom\u00e4 et al . , 2005; Shaw et al . , 2008; Hauk et al . , 2010; Sharma et al . , 2011; Yamada et al . , 2011 ) . The lack of structural insights is owed to the complex , often multisubunit architecture of Swi2\/Snf2 enzyme-containing complexes and their inherent structural flexibilities . Mot1 ( modifier of transcription 1 , also denoted BTAF1 ) is conserved from protozoa to humans and was the first Swi2\/Snf2 member for which the biochemical activity has been demonstrated in vitro ( Auble and Hahn , 1993 ) . Mot1 dissociates TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ) from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner , thereby directly regulating transcription initiation process and global redistribution of TBP in the cell ( Auble and Hahn , 1993; Dasgupta et al . , 2002; Darst et al . , 2003; Zentner and Henikoff , 2013 ) . In contrast to the majority of other Swi2\/Snf2 enzymes , Mot1 does not require any associated subunit for its essential activity and serves as a useful model system for studying Swi2\/Snf2 enzymes in vitro . The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Encephalitozoon cuniculi Mot1 ( Mot1NTD ) in complex with TBP showed that Mot1 consists of 16 HEAT repeats ( Huntingtin , elongation factor 3 , protein phosphatase 2A , lipid kinase TOR ) that are arranged in a horseshoe-like shape ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . Of note was that a long loop between HEAT repeats 2 and 3 , denoted as the \u2018latch\u2019 , can bind to TBP's concave site and block TBP\u2013DNA association . Therefore , previous analyses have revealed not only how Mot1 binds TBP , but also that Mot1 functions as a TBP chaperone . Numerous biochemical and more recent structural studies of the Mot1:TBP complex predicted the approximate positioning of the ATPase domain ( Mot1CTD ) with respect to the DNA upstream of the TATA box ( Auble and Hahn , 1993; Auble et al . , 1994; Darst et al . , 2001; Gumbs et al . , 2003; Sprouse et al . , 2006; Wollmann et al . , 2011; Moyle-Heyrman et al . , 2012 ) . A limitation of our previous work on Mot1:TBP was the finding that the crystallized state evidently represents the \u2018product\u2019 state after the remodeling reaction took place , but it remained unclear how Mot1 directly impacts the TBP:DNA \u2018substrate\u2019 state prior to the remodeling reaction ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . Obtaining a substrate state with DNA and TBP turned out to be difficult because Mot1NTD can disrupt TBP:DNA by its latch . However , we found that the Mot1:TBP:DNA complex is much more stable in the presence of negative cofactor 2 ( NC2 ) , another global transcriptional regulator , whose occurrence coincides with Mot1 and TBP at many genomic locations ( Andrau et al . , 2002; Dasgupta et al . , 2002; Hsu et al . , 2008; Van Werven et al . , 2008; Spedale et al . , 2012 ) . NC2 is a heterodimer composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits , which highly resemble histones H2A and H2B , respectively ( Kamada et al . , 2001 ) . We crystallized E . cuniculi Mot1NTD in complex with TBP , NC2 , and a TATA promoter DNA fragment and present here the crystal structure of this complex at 3 . 8 \u00c5 resolution along with biochemical , electron microscopy , and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex . Our study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2\/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex . \n Previous studies found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mot1 and NC2 can simultaneously bind to the TBP:DNA complex and could be isolated as a complex from yeast extracts ( Darst et al . , 2003; Van Werven et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that TBP:NC2 is a physiological substrate for Mot1 . In contrast , human NC2 was reported to replace the human Mot1 homolog BTAF1 bound to TBP:DNA complexes ( Klejman et al . , 2004 ) . These observations prompted us to explore whether E . cuniculi Mot1 , TBP , NC2\u03b1 , and NC2\u03b2 form a stable complex with DNA in vitro . In line with the results demonstrated in the S . cerevisiae system ( Darst et al . , 2003; Van Werven et al . , 2008 ) , we were able to reconstitute the Mot1:TBP:NC2\u03b1:NC2\u03b2 complex in the presence of a TATA box consensus sequence-containing oligonucleotide and to purify it by gel filtration ( Figure 1 ) . The Mot1NTD also formed a stable complex with TBP , NC2 , and DNA ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . From these data , it appears that complex formation between Mot1 , TBP , and NC2 on TATA DNA is evolutionary conserved . Furthermore , specific interactions between Mot1 and TBP\u2014and not for instance interactions between the Mot1CTD and the DNA\u2014are sufficient for formation of the pentameric complex . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 004 Having found that NC2 stabilized the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex , we tested if Mot1 had the ability to dissociate the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex . Consistent with the studies performed on the yeast proteins ( Darst et al . , 2003; Van Werven et al . , 2008 ) , E . cuniculi Mot1 efficiently disrupted the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex in an ATP-dependent manner ( Figure 2A ) . The latch was important for this process in reactions both with and without NC2 ( Figure 2A ) . Of note is that the presence of the NC2 subunits substantially increased the stability of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA complex and limited Mot1NTD\u2019s ability to disrupt TBP:DNA with its \u2018latch\u2019 competitor ( Figure 2B ) . However , we were not able to detect any significant changes in the Mot1-catalyzed TBP:DNA dissociation rate or the ATP hydrolysis rate of this process in the presence of NC2 ( Figure 3 ) . Taken together , these data show that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is a bona fide substrate of Mot1's remodeling activity . Moreover , in contrast to the TBP:DNA substrates , the ATPase domain is necessary to disrupt the NC2-containing complexes . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 005Figure 2 . Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes . ( A ) Upon ATP addition , Mot1 dissociated TBP from DNA ( lanes 3 and 4 ) as well as the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex ( lanes 8 and 9 ) . Mot1\u0394latch was impaired in TBP removal ( lanes 5 vs 6 and 10 vs 11 ) . ( B ) Effect of NC2 on ATP-independent remodeling by Mot1NTD . Addition of NC2 prevented the Mot1NTD from displacing TBP from DNA ( lane 3 and 6\u20138 ) . The Mot1NTD\u0394latch protein bound TBP:DNA more stably than Mot1NTD ( lane 4 ) . Addition of NC2 to Mot1NTD\u0394latch:TBP:DNA complex resulted in a distinct shift ( lanes 9\u201311 ) , consistent with formation of a stable complex containing all components .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 006 Our previously reported Mot1NTD:TBP complex structure likely represents the \u2018product\u2019 state of Mot1's remodeling reaction , i . e . , after TBP has been dissociated from DNA ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . To capture how Mot1 binds its \u2018substrate\u2019 TBP:DNA complex , i . e . , the interaction that is formed before the remodeling reaction takes place , we performed extensive crystallization experiments . Owing to the inherent instability of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA complex , we obtained only Mot1NTD:TBP crystals . However , the addition of NC2 efficiently stabilized the \u2018substrate\u2019 complex and we obtained crystals from selenomethionine-derivatized proteins diffracting to 3 . 8 \u00c5 resolution that contained all five components: Mot1NTD , TBP , NC2\u03b1 , NC2\u03b2 , and 24 base-paired TATA box-containing DNA . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using E . cuniculi Mot1NTD and TBP ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) as the search models . The initial fragments of DNA and NC2\u2014based on the human TBP:DNA:NC2 ( Kamada et al . , 2001 ) and NF-Y complex ( Nardini et al . , 2013 ) \u2014were manually fitted according to the difference density , refined as rigid bodies , and extended . We used the feature-enhanced 2Fo \u2013 Fc maps implemented in PHENIX to reduce the model bias and to enable unambigous density interpretation ( Afonine et al . , 2015 ) . The final model was refined to Rwork\/Rfree of 23 . 5\/25 . 8% with good stereochemistry ( Table 1 ) and includes 39 out of the 48 DNA bases as well as 89% of all protein residues . The sequence register was confirmed by computing anomalous difference density map that showed signal of the selenium atoms ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 007Table 1 .

In the crystal structure , we find one copy each of Mot1NTD , TBP , NC2\u03b1 , NC2\u03b2 , and 24 base pairs of DNA , in a semi-compact complex with approximate dimensions of 100 \u00c5 \u00d7 95 \u00c5 x 95 \u00c5 ( Figure 4 ) . Mot1 and NC2 occupy opposite binding surfaces on TBP and completely encircle the DNA-bound TBP molecule , which recognizes the minor groove of the TATA sequence . The Mot1NTD is oriented towards the upstream DNA ( the 5\u2019 end of the TATA box-containing strand ) and predominantly binds the convex ( \u2018top\u2019 ) side of TBP . Furthermore , like in the human TBP:DNA:NC2 complex , NC2 locks TBP onto the promoter utilizing its histone fold domain ( NC2HF ) , which is bound to the underside of the DNA , and the C-terminal helix H5 of NC2\u03b2 , which reaches around the DNA and binds the convex side of TBP ( Kamada et al . , 2001 ) . Of note is that no interpretable electron density of the Mot1 latch residues 98\u2013142 is observed . Therefore , it is probable that the latch is ordered only after binding to TBP's DNA-binding surface . Taken together , the E . cuniculi Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure shows a high degree of evolutionary conservation of the TBP:NC2 interaction on a structural level . Moreover , the encircling of TBP:DNA by NC2 explains the resistance of Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex to premature dissociation caused by the latch . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 008Figure 4 .

The HEAT repeats ( HR , yellow with N- and C-termini marked ) and insertion domain ( orange ) of the Mot1NTD bind along the convex surface of TBP and contact the C-terminal helix ( H5 ) of NC2\u03b2 . The latch of Mot1NTD ( magenta ) , which has been previously shown to bind to TBP's DNA-binding cleft , is mostly disordered in the presence of DNA and NC2 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 009 The Mot1-bound \u2018substrate\u2019 state superficially appears to be a superposition of the Mot1NTD:TBP \u2018product\u2019 state and the TBP:DNA:NC2 \u2018substrate\u2019 complex , with the important exception that the latch in the DNA-bound complex is displaced ( Figure 5A ) . Although the contacts of Mot1NTD and NC2 within the complex are mainly TBP- and\/or DNA-mediated , which is consistent with the lack of a stable interaction between Mot1 and NC2 in the absence of DNA in vitro ( data not shown ) , we observed several notable conformational differences . In comparison with the Mot1NTD:TBP \u2018product\u2019 state , the interaction between the Mot1NTD and the convex site of TBP prominently extends towards the C-terminus of Mot1NTD , engaging HEAT repeats 4 to 10 and the insertion domain . Additionally , the \u2018anchor\u2019 helix H5 of NC2\u03b2 bound to the upper side of TBP contacts the insertion domain of Mot1NTD , the only non-HEAT repeat stretch in the N-terminal part of Mot1 ( Figure 5B and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . As a result , the interaction interface between Mot1NTD and TBP's convex surface increases dramatically from \u223c900 \u00c52 to \u223c1500 \u00c52 , as calculated using the PISA server ( Krissinel and Henrick , 2007 ) , thus suggesting that Mot1 might even have a tighter grip on TBP in the presence of NC2 . The additional interactions between the loops and structural elements of the Mot1NTD and TBP result in a considerable compaction of the \u03b1-helical HEAT repeat array . Therefore , since the capability to rearrange was shown to be an essential property of long \u03b1-helical solenoids , shape adaptation and conformational changes of the Mot1's HEAT domain might play an important role in the dissociation mechanism ( Gr\u00fcnwald et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 010Figure 5 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 011 Interestingly , the kink of the longitudinal axis of the DNA duplex introduced by TBP appears to be less severe than the \u223c90\u00b0 bend observed in other TBP:DNA complexes and is slightly underwound ( Figure 5C and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) bringing the upstream DNA closer to the N- and C-termini of Mot1NTD ( the \u2018gap\u2019 of the horseshoe , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . This observation is of potential importance since the upstream part of DNA binds to the Mot1's Swi2\/Snf2 domain , which immediately follows the C-terminus of Mot1NTD ( Auble and Hahn , 1993; Auble et al . , 1994; Sprouse et al . , 2006; Darst et al . , 2001; Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , the linker helix H4 of NC2\u03b2 adopts a partially unfolded conformation and its interaction with the major groove of the downstream DNA is lost ( Figure 5D ) . Thus , Mot1 might influence the C-terminal stirrup of TBP indirectly via interaction with NC2 . ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Moreover , due to the changed DNA geometry , NC2HF is moved and rotated with respect to TBP . Despite this change , the direct interaction between the NC2HF and DNA does not seem to be affected and is similar to the interaction of histones H2A\/H2B with DNA in the nucleosome ( Luger et al . , 1997 ) . However , it has to be noted that both sides of the DNA molecule are engaged in the formation of crystal contacts; thereby , we cannot exclude the possibility that the DNA conformation is affected by crystal packing . Nevertheless , it is unlikely that crystal lattice formation can entirely explain the change in DNA trajectory ( see \u2018Discussion\u2019 ) . In summary , in the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex crystal structure , we observe a variety of small to medium conformational changes . The observed changes indicate reduced strength of the TBP\u2013DNA and DNA\u2013NC2 interactions as well as stabilization of Mot1\u2013TBP interface due to Mot1NTD binding . Upstream DNA was shown to play a crucial role not only in the stabilization of Mot1:TBP:DNA complexes , but also in the ATP-mediated dissociation in vitro ( Auble and Hahn , 1993; Darst et al . , 2001; Gumbs et al . , 2003; Sprouse et al . , 2006; Moyle-Heyrman et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , it is known that the nucleotide state of Swi2\/Snf2 domains modulates their conformation and affinity for DNA ( Lewis et al . , 2008; Moyle-Heyrman et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , in order to define the location of the Swi2\/Snf2 domain in the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex , we analyzed the full-length complex by chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry ( CX-MS ) as well as by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM , see below ) . To facilitate this analysis , we formed the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex on long TATA box-containing DNA ( at least 26 base pairs upstream from the TATA box ) and used ADP\u00b7BeFX , ATP\u03b3S , and ADP to lock the ATPase domain in ATP- and ADP-bound states ( Ponomarev et al . , 1995 ) . In our analysis , we identified 133 , 129 , and 97 inter- and intra-protein cross-links within the ADP\u00b7BeFX- , ATP\u03b3S- and ADP-bound Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes , originating from 116 , 109 , and 82 non-redundant lysine linkage pairs , respectively ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 , Table 2 and Table 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Most of the cross-links could be placed within the crystal structure or within the Mot1CTD . The cross-links that were detected between the latch ( Lys115 or Lys138 ) and other components could not be mapped since the latch is disordered in the crystal structure . The latch formed contacts with TBP , Mot1CTD as well as NC2HF , consistent with its high flexibility even in the context of full-length Mot1 . The remaining cross-links were detected between Mot1CTD and the rest of the complex . As an example , in all data sets , we found numerous cross-links between the Mot1CTD and NC2HF , mainly between the helix Hc and loop L2 ( joining helices H3 and Hc ) of NC2\u03b1 and RecA2 subdomain of Mot1CTD ( Figure 6A ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 012Table 2 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 016 As shown in Figure 6B , in the crystal structures of Swi2\/Snf2 ATPase domains , the two RecA-fold subdomains were observed to adopt a variety of different positions with respect to each other , ranging from \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018semi-closed\u2019 to \u2018closed\u2019 ( D\u00fcrr et al . , 2005; Thom\u00e4 et al . , 2005; Shaw et al . , 2008; Hauk et al . , 2010 ) . Importantly , on the basis of related SF2 helicases , ATP was shown to bind to the interface of the RecA-fold subdomains and stabilize a \u2018closed\u2019 state ( Sengoku et al . , 2006 ) . The CX-MS approach can provide insights into the architecture of protein complexes with domain to motif resolution ( Nguyen et al . , 2013; Tosi et al . , 2013; Politis et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , to gain insights into the conformation of the Swi2\/Snf2 domain in different nucleotide states , we analyzed the 32 cross-links that we detected between the two RecA-fold subdomains within Mot1CTD and mapped them onto homology models of Mot1CTD in different conformations , based on \u2018open\u2019 , \u2018semi-closed\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 states . Among these cross-links , 18 do not distinguish between these conformations , since they are all either below ( 14 ) or above ( 4 ) the distance cutoff of 30 \u00c5 , which accounts for the length of the cross-linker and two lysine side chains ( Politis et al . , 2014 , Table 3 part A ) . From the cross-links , which do distinguish between the conformations , two were present in all three data sets ( ADP , ATP\u03b3S , ADP\u00b7BeFx ) and are thus non-informative ( Table 3 part B ) . However , the remaining 4 cross-link sites ( 8 cross-links total ) were detected only in the presence of ADP\u00b7BeFx and ATP\u03b3S ( Table 3 part C ) . Notably , all of these cross-links , which were absent from the ADP data set , are only consistent with the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation ( Figure 6C , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , our data suggest that the ATP-mimicking ADP\u00b7BeFx and ATP\u03b3S analogs stabilize a more \u2018closed\u2019 conformation . Since we did not detect any cross-links that would be unique for the ADP-supplied sample , whether Mot1CTD adopts a distinct state in the presence of this nucleotide or is simply more flexible remains to be addressed in future studies . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 017Table 3 .

Part B and C list cross-links , for which the mapped distances were significantly different depending on the model used ( i . e . , <30 \u00c5 for one model and >30 \u00c5 for another ) . Eight of these cross-links ( shown also in Figure 6C ) were detected only in the presence of ADP\u00b7BeFx and ATP\u03b3S and are listed in part C . We next visualized the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by electron microscopy . We calculated a negative stain reconstruction of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex in the presence of ADP\u00b7BeFX and experimentally determined its handedness ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The 22 \u00c5 reconstruction , of overall dimensions of 115 \u00c5 \u00d7 115 \u00c5 \u00d7 100 \u00c5 , is in good agreement with the size of the partial complex observed in the crystal structure . Due to better resolution , the characteristic \u201bC\u2019-shaped structure of Mot1NTD is more pronounced than in the reconstruction of the E . cuniculi Mot1:TBP and H . sapiens BTAF1:TBP complexes ( Pereira et al . , 2004; Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , to place the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure model into the EM density , we employed an unsupervised rigid body docking approach using the Situs software package ( Wriggers , 2010 ) , which resulted in a convincing solution ( Figure 7A ) . The prominent and centered additional density , which is localized in the immediate vicinity of the N- and C-terminal ends of Mot1NTD ( the \u2018gap\u2019 of the horseshoe ) , likely harbors the C-terminal Swi2\/Snf2 domain ( Figure 7B ) . To assess the placement of Mot1CTD , we again used our CX-MS data . Using RANCH ( Petoukhov et al . , 2012 ) , we first generated a set of 20 , 000 theoretical Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 assemblies allowing flexible movement of the eight amino acid linker joining the Mot1CTD model and Mot1NTD . As suggested by the interpretation of the CX-MS data , for this analysis we used the Mot1CTD modeled in the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation . On each of the computed models , we next mapped all of the non-redundant cross-links between Mot1CTD and the rest of the complex . We repeated this procedure for the ATP\u03b3S and ADP\u00b7BeFx data sets independently ( using 28 and 31 cross-links , respectively ) . We then performed violation scoring by applying the 30 \u00c5 cutoff distance . Convincingly , for both of the independently analyzed data sets exactly the same models were among best-scored ensembles ( the lowest violation scores , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 018Figure 7 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 020 The EM- and CX-MS-derived placements not only converged , but are also in excellent agreement with the localization that has been previously determined in biochemical assays ( Auble and Hahn , 1993; Auble et al . , 1994; Darst et al . , 2001; Gumbs et al . , 2003; Sprouse et al . , 2006; Wollmann et al . , 2011; Moyle-Heyrman et al . , 2012 ) . In such an arrangement , the upstream DNA engaged by Mot1CTD directly continues from the upstream DNA of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex ( Figure 7C , D ) . Accounting for slight rearrangements within the HEAT repeats , the analysis implies that Mot1CTD would contact DNA not further than \u223c20 bp upstream from the TATA sequence . This would be in agreement with the requirement reported for the yeast Mot1 , which was shown to contact around 17 bp upstream from the TATA box ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . It is , however , not clear if the upstream NC2-bound DNA adopts B-DNA form or , like in case of a related histone fold transcriptional factor NF-Y , has bent , nucleosome-like curvature ( Huber et al . , 2012; Nardini et al . , 2013 ) . Swi2\/Snf2 ATPase motors couple ATP hydrolysis to translocation along dsDNA ( Saha et al . , 2002; Whitehouse et al . , 2003; Zofall et al . , 2006 ) . The release of TBP from DNA by Mot1 , however , does not appear to involve highly processive ATP-dependent DNA tracking ( Auble and Steggerda , 1999 ) . The changes in the TBP:DNA and NC2:DNA interactions observed in the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure suggest that Mot1NTD binding leads to an alteration of the interaction with promoter DNA . Such a potential destabilization\u2014due to the ring that is formed around DNA by TBP and NC2\u2014does not generally result in removal from TBP from DNA , consistent with our biochemical observations . However , it is possible that TBP:NC2 has an increased lateral mobility on DNA . Interestingly , in single-molecule experiments , NC2 induces dynamic conformational changes in the TBP:DNA interface , enabling TBP to laterally move on DNA substrates ( Schluesche et al . , 2007 ) . Consequently , NC2-induced lateral mobility of TBP was proposed to explain how NC2 , by sliding TBP , could lead to TBP repositioning from\/towards the promoter sites . Although the underlying conformational changes have not been seen in the TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure , our structural analysis indeed indicates changes in the DNA trajectory that are consistent with increased lateral mobility . Thus , the analysis of our structural data suggested two models for the observed dissociation of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex in the presence of ATP . One possibility is that Mot1 uses a Swi2\/Snf2 translocase activity to translocate the TBP:NC2 ring along DNA like a sliding clamp without disrupting it . In our EMSAs , the complex would eventually dissociate from DNA when the DNA end is reached . Alternatively , Mot1-induced conformational changes in the TBP:DNA:NC2 substrate could directly dissociate the complex from DNA without translocation along the DNA . To distinguish between these two options , we performed EMSAs using digoxygenin-labeled DNA , the ends of which were blocked with an anti-digoxygenin antibody . The DNA probes used were not much longer than the minimal DNA required for the formation of the complex , consisting of just 30 bp of DNA upstream of the TATA box and 9 bp of DNA downstream . As shown in Figure 8 , we observed no significant impact of the presence or placement of antibody block on either side of the DNA on the efficiency of the remodeling reaction . Therefore , in this setting Mot1 does not appear to apply highly processive sliding of TBP:NC2 along DNA but rather utilizes a more direct , local disruption mechanism consistent with previous studies of TBP\u2013DNA complexes ( Auble and Steggerda , 1999 ) . Since NC2 and TBP encircle the DNA and do not interact in the absence of DNA , Mot1 likely disrupts the TBP:NC2 interaction as well . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 021Figure 8 . Mot1-mediated displacement of TBP and NC2 from end-blocked DNA templates . Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of ATP-dependent disruption of Mot1:TBP:DNA complexes with and without NC2 as in Figure 2 , but using DNA substrates that carry a digoxygenin label at one end ( circle ) and fluorescein for DNA detection at the other end ( star ) . Reactions in lanes 13 and 14 were performed using DNA alone without digoxygenin modification , and demonstrate that the addition of digoxygenin antibody ( Y-shape ) had no effect on the mobility of unmodified DNA . Blocking of either end by the antibody did not result in a detectable decrease in TBP dissociation activity , suggesting that Mot1 does not translocate an intact TBP:NC2 clamp along DNA but locally disrupts the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex .

Mot1 , apart from being an essential gene regulator , serves as an attractive model system for structural and mechanistic studies of Swi2\/Snf2 enzymes . Here , we provide a pseudoatomic structure of the Swi2\/Snf2 enzyme Mot1 bound to its protein:DNA substrate and a detailed structural framework for the interaction of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex . Swi2\/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein:DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex . ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of the Swi2\/Snf2 ATPase domain could provide most if not all of the chemomechanical force , but a question is whether binding of the remodeler induces conformational changes in the target . Indeed , we find that the association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism . Binding of Mot1 leads to subtle but consistent conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA , which could prime the complex for ATP-dependent disruption . Although the interface between Mot1 and NC2 that we observe in the crystal structure of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is arguably very small , the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix H5 from TBP and H4 from DNA . In support of this , the very C-terminal unstructured region of NC2\u03b2 following helix H5 has been previously shown to be responsible for the repressive role of NC2 ( Yeung et al . , 1994; Yeung et al . , 1997 ) . Additionally , compared to the state in the absence of Mot1 , the conformation of the upstream DNA appears to be altered . Indeed , recent experiments have shown that Mot1:TBP:DNA and TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes are mobile and flexible due to an equilibrium between bent and unbent DNA states ( Schluesche et al . , 2007; Moyle-Heyrman et al . , 2012 ) . However , consistent with the observation that Mot1-induced dynamic DNA behavior in the TBP:DNA complex occurs also on DNA templates which are too short to directly contact the ATPase domain ( Moyle-Heyrman et al . , 2012 ) , we propose that even minimal Mot1-dependent conformational changes could have a critical impact on the TBP\u2013TATA box interaction , especially as the severely bent TATA box itself might accelerate dissociation by acting as a \u2018spring\u2019 for rapid release of TBP ( Tora and Timmers , 2010 ) . This would be in line with , for example , DNase I footprinting experiments , which showed that Mot1 binding alters TBP's TATA DNA protection pattern ( Auble and Hahn , 1993; Darst et al . , 2001; Sprouse et al . , 2006 ) , its ability to discriminate between classical and mutated TATA sequences , and why Mot1:TBP:DNA complexes can be formed by TBP mutants which are defective for TBP:DNA and Mot1:TBP complex formation ( Gumbs et al . , 2003; Klejman et al . , 2005 ) . We also note that the conformation of TBP bound to DNA in the presence of Mot1 and NC2 is somewhat distinct from that of TBP bound to DNA alone and more similar to TBP bound to Mot1 alone ( \u2018product\u2019 complex , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) , although TBP remains in a rather similar conformation . The idea that Mot1 might directly influence TBP structure has been broadly discussed , although there has not yet been any direct evidence for it ( Auble et al . , 1997; Adamkewicz et al . , 2000; Darst et al . , 2003; Gumbs et al . , 2003; Sprouse et al . , 2006; Auble , 2009 ) . Therefore , inducing substantial conformational changes in the conserved TBP core domain seems to be rather unlikely . Nevertheless , according to our observations , Mot1 could still indirectly perturb TBP's C-terminal stirrup , thereby affecting phenylalanine residues responsible for sharp DNA bending ( Kim et al . , 1993 ) . NC2 prevents assembly of TBP with other general transcription factors ( Meisterernst and Roeder , 1991; Inostroza et al . , 1992; Cang et al . , 1999; Kim et al . , 2008 ) but is retained on DNA in the absence of functional Mot1 in vitro and in vivo ( Geisberg et al . , 2002; Schluesche et al . , 2007; Van Werven et al . , 2008; de Graaf et al . , 2010 ) . While Mot1 forms a stable complex with DNA-bound TBP and NC2 , it is fully capable of disrupting this complex in the presence of ATP . Thus , our data suggest that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is not only a bona fide but perhaps even preferential substrate for Mot1 . It is possible that NC2 marks the TBP-containing complexes for Mot1-catalyzed disassembly , e . g . , to prevent the formation of aberrant transcription preinitiation complexes on intragenic regions ( Van Werven et al . , 2008; Spedale et al . , 2012; Koster et al . , 2014; Koster and Timmers , 2015 ) . In this context , it is important to note that NC2 , similarly to histones , has been shown to undergo phosphorylation , acetylation , methylation , and ubiquitination in vivo ( Dephoure et al . , 2008; Wang et al . , 2008; Van Hoof et al . , 2009; Huttlin et al . , 2010; Kim et al . , 2011; Alcolea et al . , 2012; Wagner et al . , 2012; Zhou et al . , 2013; Guo et al . , 2014; Sharma et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the impact of NC2 modifications on Mot1 recruitment and activity needs to be further investigated , especially given that the remodeling activity of Swi2\/Snf2 family members can be controlled by post-translational modification of histone substrates or remodeler subunits themselves ( Clapier et al . , 2002; Ferreira et al . , 2007; Dutta et al . , 2014 ) . Importantly , the CX-MS analysis uncovered unanticipated interactions between Mot1CTD and NC2 . The position of Mot1CTD relative to NC2HF in our CX-MS- and EM-derived models is analogous to the association of a Swi2\/Snf2 domain bound to superhelical location 2 ( SHL2 ) , i . e . , in direct proximity to the H3\/H4 histone pair slightly away from the dyad axis ( Dang and Bartholomew , 2007; Dechassa et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , most of the cross-links between the Mot1CTD and NC2HF map to the protrusion region of the RecA2-like subdomain , the major family-specific insertion region of Swi2\/Snf2 ATPases ( Flaus et al . , 2006 ) . A general role for the Swi2\/Snf2 protrusions in distorting local DNA structure has been proposed ( Hauk and Bowman , 2011 ) . For example , Snf2 has been suggested to disturb histone:DNA contacts by wedging the RecA2 lobe between DNA and protein substrates ( Dechassa et al . , 2012 ) . In our model , the Swi2\/Snf2 protrusions , especially from the RecA2 subdomain , are well positioned to directly affect DNA and NC2:DNA contacts . Therefore , the close proximity of the Mot1 Swi2\/Snf2 domain to the NC2 histone fold reveals interesting parallels to the proposed interactions of nucleosome remodelers and histones ( Figure 9 ) , although more detailed structural investigation is necessary to elucidate the extent to which these architectures are conserved or distinct . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 022Figure 9 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 07432 . 022 In summary , we provide here a first structural framework for the interaction of a Swi2\/Snf2 ATPase in complex with its protein:DNA substrate . Our structural analyses suggest a two-step mechanism for the remodeling of TBP:DNA:NC2 by Mot1 that could be relevant for other remodelers that act on histone fold protein substrates . It seems plausible to reason that in the first step , TBP's and NC2's interaction with DNA is destabilized by Mot1 binding in an ATP-independent manner . ATP binding does not result in the disassembly of the complex . The formation of the Mot1NTD:NC2 clamp ensures robust dependence on ATP hydrolysis , which triggers the final dissociation step , and which most probably occurs by very short-range translocation of the Swi2\/Snf2 domain along the minor groove . Considering the relative orientation of Mot1CTD and DNA in our model as well as the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 tracking direction shown for other Swi2\/Snf2 enzymes ( Whitehouse et al . , 2003; Zofall et al . , 2006 ) , Mot1 may move along upstream DNA towards TBP , disrupting the TBP:promoter interaction . \n N-terminally His6-tagged full-length Encephalitozoon cuniculi Mot1 ( 1\u20131256 ) and Mot1NTD ( 1\u2013778 ) and N-terminally His6-tagged full-length TBP ( 1\u2013198 ) were expressed and purified as previously described ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . E . coli BL21 Rosetta ( DE3 ) cells ( Novagen , Germany ) were used to co-express His6-tagged full-length NC2\u03b2 ( 1\u2013147 ) with the untagged full-length NC2\u03b1 ( 1\u201395 ) . Initial purification of the NC2\u03b1:NC2\u03b2 heterodimer was performed using Ni2+-NTA resin ( Qiagen , Germany ) . Tobacco etch virus protease digestion was performed to cutoff the tag . Next , ion exchange chromatography using HiTrap SP HP column ( GE Healthcare , Germany ) connected to AEKTA purifier ( GE Healthcare ) was applied followed by gel filtration using S75 16\/60 column ( GE Healthcare ) as the final step . Selenomethionine labeling in insect cells was performed for the N-terminally His6-tagged Mot1NTD construct . High 5 insect cell culture ( Invitrogen , Germany ) was adapted to Sf-900 II SFM medium ( Gibco , Germany ) by growing the cells from a starting concentration of 4\u00b7105\/ml for 4 days ( 27 . 5\u00b0C , 95 rpm ) . Subsequently , the cells were diluted to 1\u00b7106\/ml in 0 . 5 L of Sf-900 II SFM medium and infected 1:750 ( vol\/vol ) with P2 virus . The culture was grown for 12 hr and centrifuged ( 800 rpm , 10 min ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in 0 . 5 L of Sf-900 II SFM medium supplied with 75 mg of L-cysteine ( Sigma-Aldrich , Germany ) . After 4 hr of methionine depletion the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0 . 5 L of Sf-900 II SFM medium supplied with 75 mg of L-cysteine and 35 mg of L-selenomethionine ( Acros , Germany ) . The expression was carried out for 48 hr ( 27 . 5\u00b0C , 95 rpm ) . The media were supplied with 1 . 4 \u00b5g\/mL gentamycin ( Roth , Germany ) and 10 mM L-glutamine ( Gibco ) . For the derivatization in Escherichia coli expression system , the plasmids were transformed into E . coli Rosetta B834 cells ( Novagen , Germany ) and grown in LB medium ( 37\u00b0C , 200 rpm ) . The expression cultures were grown in Selenomethionine Medium Base supplemented with Nutrient Mix ( Molecular Dimensions , UK ) . Additionally , selenomethionine solution ( Acros ) at a final concentration of 42 \u00b5g\/ml was added to the sterile medium prior to inoculation . The media and selenomethionine solution were prepared according to the instruction supplied by the manufacturer . The cultures were grown until OD600 reached 0 . 4 ( 160 rpm , 37\u00b0C ) . Next , the temperature was set to 18\u00b0C and the cultures were further grown until OD600 \u2248 0 . 7 . The expression was induced with IPTG ( Roth , 0 . 5 mM ) and carried out overnight ( 18\u00b0C , 160 rpm ) . All of the used media were supplemented with appropriate antibiotics dependent on the resistance-coding expression plasmids . The applied protein purification protocols did not differ from the ones used for the purification of native proteins . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed essentially as previously described ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) using 47 bp oligonucleotide duplex probes labeled with fluorescein at the 5\u2032 end of one strand . For the EMSAs in Figure 2 , the top strand DNA sequence was 5\u2032\u2013GGGTACGGCCGGGCGCCCCGGATGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGC\u20133\u2032 . Fluorescently labeled DNA ( 0 . 5 nM ) was incubated for 20 min with TBP ( 20 nM ) and Mot1 or Mot1\u2206latch ( 30 nM ) and with or without 30 nM NC2 as indicated . ATP ( 50 \u00b5M ) was then added for 5 min . Reactions were incubated at 25\u00b0C in 4% glycerol , 4 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 8 ) , 60 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , and 100 mg\/ml bovine serum albumin and were resolved on 6% non-denaturing gels . The gels were imaged using a Typhoon Trio phosphorimager as previously described ( Wollmann et al . , 2011 ) . DNA probes used for anti-digoxygenin conjugation ( Figure 8 ) were 47 base pairs with the same sequence as above , but with either digoxygenin or fluorescein conjugated to the 5\u2032 end of either the top or bottom strand in each probe . EMSAs performed using the digoxygenin probes and anti-digoxygenin antibody ( 2 . 5 nM ) were performed in the same was as described above except that reaction products were resolved on 5% gels to improve resolution . Anti-digoxygenin antibody was from Abcam ( UK , 21H8 ) . DNA and single protein components were mixed and incubated in a stepwise manner at 4\u00b0C . TBP was first added to the TATA box-containing DNA in excess . This was followed by the addition of NC2 and Mot1\/Mot1NTD . Finally , the sample was centrifuged and loaded onto a S200 10\/300 GL column connected to AEKTA purifier ( GE Healthcare ) . 20 mM MES pH 6 . 5 , 60 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT or 20 mM HEPES pH 8 . 2 , 60 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT were used for the crystallization or EM and CX-MS analyses , respectively . Oligonucleotides were ordered from Biomers , Germany . For the crystallization of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex , 24 double-stranded DNA ( 5\u2032-AGTAGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGC-3\u2032 top strand ) was used . The peak gel filtration fractions were pooled , concentrated by ultrafiltration ( Millipore , Germany ) , and centrifuged . The crystals were grown at 20\u00b0C for 7\u201314 days by hanging drop vapor diffusion technique . Best diffraction quality crystals were obtained by serial streak seeding from selenomethionine-derivatized proteins and grown in 0 . 2 M imidazole malate pH 5 . 1 and 9\u201316% PEG4000 condition . The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using original condition supplemented with 25% glycerol for cryoprotectection . Diffraction data was collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ID-29 ) at 100 K and \u03bb = 0 . 9794 \u00c5 . The data were processed with XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) in the space group C 1 2 1 ( a = 150 . 6 \u00c5 , b = 140 . 3 \u00c5 , c = 90 . 8 \u00c5 , \u03b1 = 90 . 0\u00b0 , \u03b2 = 113 . 7\u00b0 , \u03b3 = 90 . 0\u00b0 ) with 60% solvent and one complex per asymmetric unit . The structure was successfully solved by molecular replacement with Phaser , part of the CCP4 software suite ( McCoy et al . , 2007; Winn et al . , 2011 ) . Homology model of the NC2 heterodimer was prepared using CHAINSAW ( CCP4 , Stein , 2008; Winn et al . , 2011 ) . The structure was refined in BUSTER ( v . 2 . 10 . 1 ) at 3 . 8 \u00c5 using TLS refinement strategy ( Bricogne et al . , 2011 ) and manually rebuilt in Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Solvent flattening was performed with Parrot ( CCP4 , Cowtan , 2010; Winn et al . , 2011 ) . B-factor sharpening and calculation of feature-enhanced 2Fo \u2013 Fc map was performed using PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010; Afonine et al . , 2015 ) . The histone fold region was characterized by relatively high B-factors and poor density and , therefore , the side chains of the residues NC2\u03b1 15\u201389 and NC2\u03b2 12\u2013101 were omitted in the final model . The quality of the structure was evaluated with MolProbity ( Davis et al . , 2007 ) ; 96% , 4% , and 0 . % of the residues were in Ramachandran favored , allowed , and outlier regions , respectively . For the negative stain EM analysis of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex , 38 dsDNA was used ( 5\u2032\u2013CAGGCCGGGCGCCCGGCATGGCGGCCTATAAAAGGGTC\u20133\u2032 top strand ) . The sample was supplied with 1 mM ADP\u00b7BeFX . For the grid preparation sample was diluted to 25 \u00b5g\/ml . The sample was applied to glow-discharged continuous carbon-coated grids . 5 \u00b5l of the sample was incubated for 1 min , blotted dry , washed twice with water , and finally fixed in a 1% ( wt\/vol ) uranyl acetate solution . A total of 144 micrographs were recorded manually on a CM200 field emission gun transmission electron microscope ( Philips , Netherlands ) operated at 200 keV . Images were recorded on a 4k \u00d7 4k Gatan Ultrascan CCD camera using a defocus ranging from 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 \u03bcm and a dose of 25 e\u2212\/\u00c52 . The pixel size corresponded to 1 . 61 \u00c5 on the specimen level . Contrast-transfer function ( CTF ) determination and phase correction of the micrographs were performed using the TOM software package ( Nickell et al . , 2005 ) . From the corrected micrographs a total of 27 , 276 particles were selected using the \u2018boxer\u2019 tool from EMAN2 ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . All subsequent image processing was carried out in XMIPP ( Scheres et al . , 2008 ) . The particles were normalized before further analysis by two-dimensional ( 2D ) reference-free alignment and classification using the ML2D algorithm . Initial reconstruction of a 3D volume from the particles was carried out using a reference-free approach using a sphere with the approximate particle diameter ( 10 nm ) as an initial model for de novo ML3D alignment . Subsequently , ML3D classification was performed to sort out broken complexes or other non-particles , resulting in 8192 particles used for further refinement . The generated de novo model was filtered to 40 \u00c5 and used as an initial reference for iterative projection-matching refinement yielding the final reconstruction of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2:ADP\u00b7BeFX complex at a resolution of 22 \u00c5 , according to FSC ( 0 . 5 criterion ) of two averages , each comprising 50% of the data . The resulting volume showed a good agreement with the previously RCT reconstructed map of Mot1 , although more details were present . The map shows all features expected for the determined resolution , most pronounced in the C-shaped contour of the Mot1 protein itself . The resulting volume was furthermore assessed using different approaches ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . For the CX-MS analysis of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex , 42 double-stranded DNA was used ( 5\u2032\u2013CAGTACGGCCGGGCGCCCGGCATGGCGGCCTATAAAAGGGTC\u20133\u2032 top strand ) . The complex sample at 0 . 66 mg\/ml was supplemented with 1 mM ATP\u03b3S , 1 mM ADP , or 1 mM ADP\u00b7BeFX ( formed by mixing ADP , BeCl2 and NaF in 1:1:4 molar ratio ) . An equimolar mixture of isotopically light ( d0 ) - and heavy ( d6 ) -labeled disulfosuccinimidyl glutarate ( DSSG; Creative Molecules , Canada ) was dissolved in H2O at a concentration of 50 mM . 55 \u00b5g of protein complex were incubated with DSSG ( 0 . 32 mM final concentration ) for 35 min at 30\u00b0C ( 1000 rpm ) . The reaction was quenched by adding 1 M Tris\u2013HCl pH 8 . 0 to a final concentration of 100 mM , followed by incubation for further 15 min at 30\u00b0C ( 1000 rpm ) . The cross-linking efficiency was visualized by SDS-PAGE in combination with silver staining following standard protocols ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Proteins were in the following digested using a standard in-solution protocol . In brief , proteins were denatured by adding two volumes of 8 M urea ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Cross-linked proteins were reduced with 5 mM final concentration tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP , Thermo Scientific , Germany ) for 45 min at 35\u00b0C and subsequently alkylated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature ( 10 mM iodoacetamide final concentration ) . Proteins were pre-digested for 2 hr with lysyl endopeptidase ( LysC , Wako , Germany ) at 35\u00b0C at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1\u201350 ( wt\/wt ) . The protein solution was diluted with four volumes of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate ( ABC ) , and a second digest was performed overnight with trypsin ( Promega , Germany , 1\/50 [wt\/wt] at 35\u00b0C , 1000 rpm ) . Peptides were acidified with 1% ( vol\/vol ) trifuoroacetic acid ( TFA , Sigma\u2013Aldrich ) and purified by solid-phase extraction using C18 cartridges ( Sep-Pak , Waters , Germany ) . The desalted eluate was dried by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 20 \u00b5l of size exclusion chromatography mobile phase ( 25% acetonitrile [ACN] , 0 . 1% TFA ) . 15 \u00b5l hereof was injected into a GE Healthcare \u00c4KTAmicro chromatography system via autosampler . Peptides were separated on a Superdex Peptide PC 3 . 2\/30 column ( GE Healthcare ) at a flow rate of 25 \u00b5l\/min . 100 \u00b5l fractions were collected in a 96-well plate over a separation window of one column volume . The four fractions containing cross-linked peptides were dried to completeness and reconstituted in 2% ACN , 0 . 1% formic acid ( FA ) . Peptides sample were analyzed on an LC-MS\/MS system using an UHPLC ( EASY-nLC 1000 ) online coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite ( both Thermo Scientific ) equipped with a standard nanoelectrospray source . A volume corresponding to an estimated 1 \u00b5g of peptide was injected onto a 15 cm \u00d7 0 . 050 mm I . D . reversed phase column packed with 2 \u00b5m C18 beads ( Acclaim PepMap RSLC analytical column , Thermo Scientific ) . Peptides were separated using a 60 min gradient of solvent B ( 98% ACN , 0 . 1% FA ) from 2% to 35% at a flow rate of 250 nl\/min . Each sample was injected twice to improve identification of cross-linked peptides . The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode , selecting up to 10 precursors from a MS1 scan ( resolution = 120 , 000 ) in a mass range of 300\u20132000 m\/z for rapid collision-induced dissociation ( rCID ) . Singly and doubly charged precursors as well as precursors of unknown charge state were rejected for MS2 selection . CID was performed for 10 ms using 35% normalized collision energy and an activation q of 0 . 25 . Dynamic exclusion was activated with a repeat count of 1 , exclusion duration 30 s at a list size of 500 and a mass window of \u00b110 ppm . Ion target values were 1 , 000 , 000 ( or maximum fill time of 10 ms ) for the survey scan and 10 , 000 ( or maximum fill time of 100 ms ) for the MS2 scan , respectively . For data analysis , Thermo Xcalibur . RAW files were first converted to the open mzXML format using msconvert tool ( ProteoWizard , Kessner et al . , 2008 ) . Cross-linked peptide candidates were extracted using the xQUEST ( v . 2 . 1 . 1 ) pipeline including xProphet for FDR calculations ( Walzthoeni et al . , 2012 ) . Standard settings were used . In brief , data were searched against a self-defined database containing Mot1 , TBP , and NC2 proteins . Maximum number of missed cleavages ( excluding the cross-linking site ) = 2 , peptide length = 4\u201345 , enzyme = trypsin , fixed modifications = carbamidomethyl-Cys ( 57 . 02146 Da ) , variable modification = Met-oxidation ( 15 . 99491 Da ) , mass shift of the light cross-linker ( 96 . 02112937 Da ) , MS1 tolerance = 10 ppm , MS2 tolerance = 0 . 2 for common ions and 0 . 3 Da for cross-linked ions . The theoretical candidate spectra were scored according to their quality of the match and cross-linked candidates were filtered by a MS1 mass tolerance of \u22125 to 5 ppm and a \u0394score of \u226515% ( indicating the relative score difference to the next ranked match ) . All spectra passing the filtering criteria were further manually validated . Identifications were only considered for the final result list in case both peptides had at least four bond cleavages in total or three adjacent ones and a minimum length of five amino acids . Full list of the detected cross-links can be found in Table 2\u2014source data 1 . The rigid body docking of Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure was performed using colores applying a 10\u00b0 sampling step size ( Chac\u00f3n and Wriggers , 2002 ) . The search probe was down-filtered to 22 \u00c5 , and Laplacian filter ( maximizing the fitting contrast ) was applied . The DNA was omitted from the model , and the missing side chains of NC2HF were included and set to most common rotamers . The fitting was preformed for the correct and mirrored reconstruction and resulted in several fits of the Mot1NTD:TBP:NC2 module . After manual inspection , two very similar solutions ( for the rightful hand ) were qualified as the correct solution . The other fits were nonsense fits resulted from template drifting , which often occurs at low resolution when the structure represents only a part of the density it is docked into ( Chac\u00f3n and Wriggers , 2002 ) . The set of Mot1CTD orientations ( n = 20 , 000 ) was generated using RANCH , part of the EOM package ( Petoukhov et al . , 2012 ) in a \u2018compact\u2019 mode , where Mot1NTD:TBP:NC2 module was assumed to be flexibly linked to Mot1CTD via the eight amino acid linker ( residues 779\u2013786 , not present in the atomic models ) . Next , the models were displayed and the distances were measured using a standard script in PyMOL Molecular Graphics System ( v . 1 . 5 . 0 . 4 Schr\u00f6dinger , LLC ) . Finally , the models were scored according to the number of cross-links violating the 30 \u00c5 cutoff distance . For residues NC2\u03b1 K61 , K62 , K92 , and NC2\u03b2 K27 , which were not visible in the crystal structure ( i . e . , comprising short loop regions ) but important for the analysis , the distances refer to the position which could be unambiguously modeled based on the crystal structure of NF-Y complex ( PDB-ID 4AWL , Nardini et al . , 2013 ) . All reported distances between detected cross-linked lysines refer to the Euclidean C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distances between the residues . The figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera package ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , PyMOL Molecular Graphics System ( v . 1 . 5 . 0 . 4 Schr\u00f6dinger , LLC ) and OriginPro 8 G ( OriginLab , Northampton , MA ) . The coordinates and structure factors of the crystal structure were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 4WZS . The EM reconstruction map was deposited in the EMDB database under accession code 2828 .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["structural biology and molecular biophysics"],"id":"elife-07432-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"Human reproductive cells\u2014eggs and sperm\u2014are produced through a process called meiosis . This means a \u2018parent\u2019 cell in the ovaries or testes undergoes two stages of cell division: it first divides into two cells , which then divide again to produce four \u2018daughter\u2019 cells . A crucial part of meiosis is ensuring that each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell did . Before the first round of meiosis , the chromosomes in the parent cell are copied to produce enough chromosomes for the four daughter cells . The distribution of these chromosomes between the daughter cells is determined by the opposing forces acting on them . The pairs of identical chromosomes produced during the copying process are held together by a proteinaceous glue , while microtubules attached to a structure called the spindle\u2014which has poles at opposite ends of the cell\u2014try to pull these pairs of chromosomes apart . Rattani et al . now show that a protein called shugoshin-like 2 ( Sgol2 ) , which is involved in holding pairs of identical chromosomes together after the first round of division , has a bigger role than was previously realised . Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by , it is thought , facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process . The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified . Thus , Rattani et al . show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis , Sgol2 appears to have a key , if not unique , role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide .","article":"Accurate chromosome segregation depends on coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( K-fibers ) , a process regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) . How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear . We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) in addition to protecting cohesin , plays an important role in turning off the SAC , in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles , in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching . Sgol2\u2019s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A , as is its ability to silence the SAC , with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2 . In contrast , its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively . By virtue of its multiple interactions , Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation . \n The production of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells depends on two rounds of chromosome segregation ( meiosis I and II ) without an intervening round of DNA replication . Defects during the first or second meiotic division in oocytes lead to formation of aneuploid eggs , which in humans occurs with a frequency between 10 and 30% and is a major cause of fetal miscarriages ( Hassold and Hunt , 2001 ) . Understanding the causes of meiotic chromosome missegregation will require clarifying not only the forces and regulatory mechanisms governing meiotic chromosome segregation but also how these are coordinated . At the heart of this process are two opposing forces . The pulling forces produced by kinetochore-microtubules attachments ( K-fibers ) and resisting forces generated by sister chromatid cohesion , which counteracts K-fiber forces if and when kinetochores attach to microtubules with different polarities . During meiosis I , cohesion along chromosome arms holds bivalent chromosomes together following the creation of chiasmata produced by reciprocal recombination between homologous non-sister chromatids . This cohesion must persist during the attachment of maternal and paternal kinetochores to microtubules from opposite poles ( bi-orientation ) and resist the resulting spindle forces . The degree of traction exerted by meiotic spindles must create sufficient tension to facilitate bi-orientation ( Tachibana-Konwalski et al . , 2010 ) . During the bi-orientation process , the initial attachment of kinetochores to the surface of the microtubule lattice ( lateral attachment ) is converted to attachments to their plus ends ( end on attachment ) , creating K-fibers . Because this process is intrinsically error prone , inappropriate attachments , for example those that connect maternal and paternal kinetochores to the same pole , must be disrupted through phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B\/C kinases ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . However , because these kinases disrupt K-fibers , they must subsequently be down regulated once bivalents bi-orient correctly . The first meiotic division is eventually triggered by activation of a gigantic ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome ( APC\/C ) whose destruction of securin and cyclin B activates a thiol protease called separase that cleaves the kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex holding sister chromatids together ( McGuinness et al . , 2005; Kudo et al . , 2006 ) . This process converts chromosomes from bivalents to dyads . It is delayed until all bivalents have bi-oriented by the production , at kinetochores that have not yet come under tension , of a potent inhibitor of the APC\/C called the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) whose Mad2 subunit binds tightly to the APC\/C\u2019s Cdc20 co-activator protein . This regulatory mechanism , called the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) , must be turned off before APC\/CCdc20 can direct destruction of securin and cyclin B and thereby activate separase . Another pre-condition for cleavage , at least in yeast , is phosphorylation of cohesin\u2019s kleisin subunit by a pair of protein kinases , namely CK1\u03b4\/\u03b5 and DDK ( Ishiguro et al . , 2010; Katis et al . , 2010 ) . During the first meiotic division , cohesin is phosphorylated along chromosome arms but not at centromeres , which ensures that only cohesion along arms is destroyed by separase at the onset of anaphase I . The consequent persistence of cohesion at centromeres promotes bi-orientation of dyads during meiosis II . Centromeric cohesin avoids phosphorylation and therefore cleavage during the first meiotic division because separase activation is preceded by the recruitment to centromeres of orthologues of the Drosophila MEI-S332 protein , called shugoshins . Members of this family contain a conserved C-terminal basic region and an N-terminal homodimeric parallel coiled coil , which provides a docking site for protein phosphatase 2A\u2019s ( PP2A ) C and B\u2019 subunits ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . In budding yeast , mutant proteins defective specifically in PP2A binding fail to confer protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Mammals have two members of the shugoshin family: Shugoshin-like protein 1 ( Sgol1 ) , and Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) . The former prevents centromeric cohesin from a process called the \u2018prophase pathway\u2019 that removes cohesin from chromosomes by a non-proteolytic mechanism soon after cells enter mitosis ( McGuinness et al . , 2005; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Sgol2 , on the other hand , protects centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al . , 2008; Llano et al . , 2008 ) . Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil domain binds PP2A in vitro ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) but whether this is vital for protecting centromeric cohesion is not known . Sgol2 also interacts with MCAK ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) , a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin , implicated in correcting inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( error correction ) , and with Mad2 an essential component of the MCC ( Orth et al . , 2011 ) . Shugoshins , though not explicitly Sgol2 , have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase , necessary both for the SAC and for error correction ( Tsukahara et al . , 2010; Yamagishi et al . , 2010 ) . Based on its interactions , Sgol2 has been linked to cohesion protection , the spindle assembly checkpoint , and error correction pathways . However , the physiological significance of these multiple interactions remain unclear . We show here that Sgol2 defective in PP2A binding fails to protect centromeric cohesin , as found for Sgo1 in yeast ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . However , if this were the sole function of Sgol2 , then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected . To our surprise , we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics . It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles , caused increased bivalent stretching , and greatly increased Aurora B\/C kinase activity at kinetochores , which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments . Lastly , Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC\/CCdc20 activation , suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC . Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2 , it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK , and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B\/C kinase specifically at kinetochores . Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes . Our findings imply that through its multi-domain structure , Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array . \n An essential feature of shugoshins is a conserved N-terminal homodimeric coiled coil that binds PP2A ( Figure 1A ) . Unlike Sgol1 , which only interacts stably with the PP2A holoenzyme ( a complex of A , B\u2019 and C subunits ) , Sgol2 also associates with a core complex containing only A and C subunits ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . To create versions of Sgol2 defective specifically in binding PP2A , conserved residues ( namely L51 , N54 , R56 , and E82 ) predicted to interact directly with PP2A were substituted by alanine or in the case of E82 also by lysine ( Figure 1B ) . Likewise , the highly conserved asparagine ( N55 on Sgol2 ) , corresponding to N61 in Sgol1 , which forms a hydrogen bond within the coiled coil enabling it to adopt a conformation compatible with PP2A binding , was substituted by isoleucine ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , binding between purified Flag- and His-tagged Sgol2 fragments spanning the coiled coil ( cc ) region ( 31\u2013117 ) was unaffected by any of these mutations , implying that all permit coiled coil formation . A triple mutation L51A\/N54A\/R56A ( 3A ) reduced dimerization modestly ( Figure 1D ) but this effect was not seen when the two proteins were co-expressed in bacteria ( Figure 1E ) . To assess the effects on PP2A binding , GST-tagged PP2A A subunit was incubated with B\u2019 and C subunits in the presence of MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag . Pull down experiments revealed that N55I and the 3A triple mutation abolished co-purification of Sgol2 with the GST-tagged A subunit while N54A and R56A reduced it . In contrast , L51A and E82A had little or no effect while E82K caused a modest reduction ( Figure 1F ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 003Figure 1 .

( B ) Sequence alignment of the coiled coil domains of Sgol1 and Sgol2 from different vertebrate species . Arrowheads below the alignment indicate conserved residues ( L51 , N54 , R56 , and E82 ) in the coiled coil domain of Sgol2 mapping onto binding sites between PP2A and Sgol1 . The conserved asparagine residue ( N55 in mSgol2 ) , important for maintaining the interaction surface of the coiled coil domain , is marked by an arrowhead above the alignment . ( C ) Sequence alignment of conserved MIM ( Mad2 Interaction Motif ) in Sgol2 , Mad1 , and Cdc20 from Xenopus , human and mouse origin . ( D ) Dimerization assay of coiled coil domains from wild type and mutant Sgol2 . The Flag-tagged MBP-Sgol2cc ( 31\u2013117 ) was pulled down by the His-tagged MBP-Sgol2cc ( 31\u2013117 ) with the same substitution . Homodimerisation was assessed by the relative abundance of each form in the IP by western blots . ( E ) Co-immunoprecipitation assay of MBP-Sgol2cc from wild type and 3A mutant are shown to validate the homodimerisation of coiled coil domains . MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag and MBP-Sgol2cc-His were expressed either independently , or co-expressed . After His-tag pull-down , each fraction was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag and anti-His antibodies . Input was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE .

Sgol2 fragment spanning amino-acid ( aa ) residues 120\u2013180 with wild type and mutant MIM sequences were assessed for Mad2 interaction by far-western blot . Fragments from Xenopus Sgol1 , with and without MIM domain , were used as positive and negative controls . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 003 To investigate whether association of PP2A with Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion , we compared the effect of the mutations on PP2A\u2019s co-localization with Sgol2 at kinetochores with their effect on the maintenance of cohesion after oocytes have undergone the first meiotic division . Sgol2 and PP2A co-localize at inner kinetochores of bivalent chromosomes at metaphase I in wild type oocytes ( Figure 2A ) but neither protein was detected at this location in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes ( n = 26 ) . Importantly , microinjection of wild type Sgol2 encoding mRNA into sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes restored accumulation at kinetochores of both Sgol2 and PP2A at metaphase I . In contrast , microinjection of mRNAs carrying N54A , N55I , or 3A mutations restored Sgol2 but not PP2A ( Figure 2A ) , implying that binding of PP2A to Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil is necessary for recruiting the phosphatase to kinetochores in vivo . Chromosome spreads revealed that the failure of sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes to maintain cohesion between sister centromeres after meiosis I was reversed by microinjection of wild type but not N54A , N55I , or 3A mRNAs ( Figure 2B ) . L51A and E82A , which had little or no effect on PP2A\u2019s binding to Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil in vitro , also fully restored cohesion protection while R56A and E82K , which caused a modest reduction in the Sgol2cc-PP2A interaction vitro , only partially restored it , producing metaphase II oocytes containing individual chromatids as well as dyads ( Figure 2B ) . Lastly , we noticed that injection of 3A Sgol2 mRNAs also produced centromeric cohesion defects in wild type oocytes ( Figure 3A , B ) . The correlation between the effects of mutations on binding PP2A in vitro and on protecting cohesion in vivo implies that the interaction of PP2A with Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil is essential for protecting cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 004Figure 2 . Sgol2-PP2A interaction is required to recruit PP2A to kinetochores and protect centromeric cohesion at the first meiotic division . ( A ) GV oocytes were harvested in the presence of IBMX . Microinjections were performed at GV stage in M2 medium supplemented with IBMX . Oocytes were then cultured in IBMX-free medium for about 6 hr , corresponding to metaphase I stage .

Sgol2-PP2A , but not Sgol2-Mad2 , interaction is required to protect centromeric cohesion at the first meiotic division . ( A ) Oocytes harvested at GV stage from wild type ( control ) mice were microinjected with wild type or 3A mutant Sgol2 mRNA in M2 medium supplemented with IBMX . After releasing the oocytes in M16 medium without IBMX , chromosome spreads were prepared from metaphase II-arrested oocytes and stained with DAPI ( blue ) and CREST ( green ) . ( B ) Frequencies of dyads and single chromatids observed on metaphase II-stage chromosome spreads . Numbers of oocytes examined are indicated ( n ) . ( C ) Metaphase I localization of Sgol2 ( red ) and PP2A-C ( green ) on chromosomes from sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes microinjected with H150E Sgol2 mRNA . ( D ) DAPI ( blue ) and CREST ( green ) stained chromosome spreads prepared from metaphase II-stage oocytes . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 005 DIC video microscopy revealed that sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes extruded polar bodies on average 2 hr later than oocytes from wild type littermates . Moreover , only 61% of sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes extruded the first polar body compared with 88% in wild type controls ( Figure 4A ) . To investigate this , wild type and sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes were microinjected with mRNA encoding histone H2B-mCherry to mark chromosomes and Securin-eGFP to measure APC\/CCdc20 activity ( Figure 4B ) . 40% of mutant oocytes failed to activate APC\/CCdc20 compared to 12% in wild type controls ( Figure 4C ) , and those that did so were delayed by about 2 hr ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Surprisingly , microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA not only increased the fraction of oocytes that activated APC\/CCdc20 to wild type levels ( 89% ) , but also advanced activation so that it took place about 2 hr earlier than in wild type ( Figure 4E\u2013G , Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) . Because microinjection of mRNA encoding a version of Cdc20 ( R132A ) that cannot bind Mad2 , but not wild type Cdc20 , induced securin destruction in all sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes ( Figure 4C ) , we conclude that Sgol2 facilitates APC\/CCdc20 activation by silencing the SAC and that this process is dose dependent . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 006Figure 4 .

( C ) Frequencies of oocytes that destroyed Securin-eGFP , hence activated APC\/CCdc20 , at the metaphase-anaphase transition are shown .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 009 The recent observation that shugoshins , like Sgol2 from humans and Sgo1 from Xenopus , bind Mad2 in a manner similar to Mad1 and Cdc20 through a conserved Mad2 Interaction Motif ( MIM ) ( Orth et al . , 2011 ) provided a clue as to how Sgol2 might regulates the SAC . This motif is conserved in mouse Sgol2 ( Figure 1C ) and far-western blots confirmed that interaction between mSgol2 and Mad2 is weakened by substituting the basic amino acid at its center with alanine ( H150A ) or glutamic acid ( H150E ) ( Figure 1G ) . Strikingly , H150E and H150A Sgol2 mRNAs were less effective than wild type in increasing the fraction of sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes that activated APC\/CCdc20 ( Figure 4E ) . They also failed to advance the timing of activation ( Figure 4F , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B , C ) . Importantly , neither mutation affected Sgol2\u2019s association with kinetochores , its ability to recruit PP2A ( Figure 3C ) or MCAK ( Figure 5A ) to this location , or protection of centromeric cohesion ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , N54A , which reduces PP2A binding , also abrogated Sgol2\u2019s ability to promote APC\/CCdc20 activation ( Figure 4E , F , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A , D ) without having any effect on MCAK recruitment ( Figure 5A ) . We conclude that Sgol2 has an important role in silencing the SAC during meiosis I by binding directly both to Mad2 and PP2A . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 010Figure 5 .

Scale bars represent 5 \u03bcm . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 012 We noticed that chiasmata appeared terminalized in a large fraction of bivalent chromosomes from sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes ( Figure 5A ) . Because this effect was not accompanied by any reduction of cohesin along inter-chromatid axes ( Figure 5B ) , it is unlikely to be caused by precocious Rec8 cleavage . Live cell imaging of oocytes microinjected at the GV stage with mRNAs encoding H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that maternal and paternal kinetochores were pulled further apart in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes at metaphase I ( t test , p<0 . 0001 ) . In other words , bivalents were stretched more and possibly the stretching of distal parts of bivalent chromosomes resulted in increased separation of homologous pairs on chromosome spreads . Importantly , increased kinetochore separation in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes was invariably observed on bivalents that had bi-oriented ( Figures 5C and 6; see also Videos 1 and 2 ) , but was not accompanied by any change in the overall length of metaphase I spindles ( ANOVA , p=0 . 97; Figure 5D ) . Interestingly , microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA not only rescued chiasmata structure ( Figure 5A ) , but also reduced inter-kinetochore distances to below that seen in wild type ( Figures 5C and 6; Video 3 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) , without altering spindle length ( Figure 5D ) . Because a similar reduction in inter-kinetochore distances was observed with N54A or H150E mutations ( Figures 5C and 6; Videos 4 and 5 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) , regulation of bivalent stretching by Sgol2 does not depend on its ability to bind PP2A or Mad2 . Thus , the effect cannot be due to changes either in arm cohesion protection or duration of metaphase I . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 013Figure 6 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 019 Inter-kinetochore distances correlated inversely with GFP-MCAK signals at kinetochores . Thus , MCAK is missing from kinetochores in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes and more abundant ( even than wild type ) in mutant cells microinjected with Sgol2 mRNA ( Figures 5A , C and 6 ) . Because phosphorylation of human Sgol2 at T537 and T620 ( corresponding to T521 and T600 on M . m Sgol2 ) by Aurora B has been implicated in the association of MCAK with Sgol2 in mitotic cells ( Tanno et al . , 2010 ) , we tested the effect of AZD1152 , an Aurora B ( and C ) kinase inhibitor . This eliminated accumulation at kinetochores of both T521 phosphorylated Sgol2 ( Figure 7B ) and MCAK ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Crucially , injection of mRNA encoding T521A T600A Sgol2 into sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes failed to restore accumulation of MCAK at kinetochores ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and to reduce inter-kinetochore distances ( Figures 5C and 6; Video 6 , t test p=0 . 027 ) . Interestingly , neither the Aurora B\/C inhibitor nor T521A T600A prevented MCAK\u2019s recruitment to chromosome arms ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The effect of T521A T600A on MCAK\u2019s kinetochore binding was highly specific as the mutant Sgol2 protein still accumulated at kinetochores ( albeit to a lesser extent ) , recruited PP2A to this location , and protected centromeric cohesion from separase ( Figure 5E , F ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 020Figure 7 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 021 These observations suggest that bivalent stretching might be inhibited by recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by Sgol2 . If so , increased inter-kinetochore distances in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes should be reduced by targeting MCAK to centromeres by artificial means , namely by expression of an MCAK protein whose N-terminus is fused to the C-terminus of CENPB-eGFP . Remarkably , CENPB-eGFP-MCAK , but not CENPB-eGFP , reduced inter-kinetochore distances ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2; Video 7 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) . We conclude that Sgol2 moderates the pulling force exerted on bivalents by recruiting MCAK to kinetochores , a process dependent on phosphorylation of Sgol2 by Aurora B\/C kinases . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 022Video 7 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 022 The period between Germinal Vesicle Breakdown ( GVBD ) and anaphase can be divided according to the state of spindles and chromosomes into four distinct phases ( Schuh and Ellenberg , 2007; Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . During phase 1 , multiple microtubule-organizing centers ( MTOCs ) form a ball of polymerizing microtubules on whose surface chromosomes are distributed individually . This is followed by a period ( phase 2 ) in which chromosomes slide laterally over the ball shaped spindle apparatus , eventually congressing to form a \u2018prometaphase\u2019 belt around it . During phase 3 , chromosomes invade the cluster of microtubules , which elongates along an axis perpendicular to the earlier chromosome belt , forming a barrel-shaped bipolar spindle . This highly dynamic phase culminates when chromosomes bi-orient on a metaphase plate within the bipolar spindle . During the fourth and final stage ( phase 4 ) , bi-oriented chromosomes oscillate around the metaphase plate with low amplitudes ( Phase 4 ) . Live-cell confocal imaging of wild type mouse oocytes microinjected with H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that MCAK accumulates at MTOCs and on microtubules during phase 1 ( Figure 6; Video 1 ) but does not appear at kinetochores until chromosomes congress on the surface of the ball at the start of phase 2 . This event is accompanied by an increase in Sgol2\u2019s abundance at kinetochores and by phosphorylation of T521 ( Figure 7A , B ) . MCAK\u2019s abundance at kinetochores gradually increases during phase 3 as chromosomes invade the spindle apparatus and peaks as chromosomes bi-orient on the metaphase plate ( Figure 6 , top panel; Video 1 ) . This sequence of events is substantially altered in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes . Though GFP-MCAK co-localizes with MTOCs and microtubules , it never subsequently accumulates at kinetochores ( Figure 6 ) . Chromosomes associate with the surface of the ball , albeit more loosely than in wild type , and undergo visible stretching instead of forming a prometaphase belt ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1; Video 2 ) . This excessive stretching becomes even more pronounced upon formation of bipolar spindles . Thus , the clear demarcation of congression during phase 2 and bi-orientation during phase 3 was largely absent . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNAs into sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes greatly accelerated both invasion of the ball by chromosomes and their bi-orientation , with the latter occurring even earlier than in wild type oocytes and before metamorphosis of the ball into a bipolar spindle ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1; Video 3 ) . Thus , while loss of Sgol2 delays bi-orientation , the modest over-expression caused by mRNA microinjection accelerates this process . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 023Figure 8 . Sgol2 promotes bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes by increasing kinetochore-microtubule interactions . ( A ) To study the relative distributions of chromosomes on the ball shaped spindle , at 2\u20133 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were treated with Ca2+ buffer for 90 s and then fixed in 1% PFA .

Injection of Sgol2 T521A T600A still advanced polar body extrusion ( Figure 6 ) , demonstrating that SAC silencing by Sgol2 does not depend on rapid or possibly even accurate chromosome bi-orientation and suggesting that these activities are mediated by separate domains within Sgol2 . Surprisingly , injection of mRNAs encoding CENPB-eGFP-MCAK instead of Sgol2 did not accelerate chromosome bi-orientation ( data not shown ) , raising the possibility that Sgol2 facilitates bi-orientation by a mechanism either independent of or in addition to MCAK\u2019s recruitment to kinetochores . Because , bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes correlates with the appearance of kinetochore-microtubule bundles ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) , we visualized these in oocytes fixed in 1% PFA following a brief treatment with a calcium-containing buffer , which destabilizes the more dynamic non-kinetochore-microtubules . This revealed three differences between wild type and sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD , when most kinetochores in wild type have relinquished lateral and formed end on attachments and chromosomes have bi-oriented . Kinetochore associated microtubules bundles ( K-fibers ) were thinner and more sparse , lateral attachments were greatly increased in frequency , and kinetochores ( as detected by CREST antibodies ) were frequently highly stretched in mutant oocytes ( Figure 8B ) . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA had the opposite effect , eliminating lateral attachments and kinetochore stretching while greatly increasing the abundance of end-on microtubules associated with each kinetochore , an effect abrogated by T521A T600A ( Figure 8B ) . This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B\/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates chromosome bi-orientation . Because injection of CENPB-eGFP-MCAK mRNAs instead of Sgol2 largely failed to increase end-on attachments at the expense of lateral ones ( Figure 8B ) , we suspect that Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B\/C has a function at kinetochores besides MCAK recruitment ( see below ) . Because Aurora B kinase destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments , at least partly by phosphorylating proteins within the KMN network ( Welburn et al . , 2010 ) , we tested whether Sgol2 altered the phosphorylation of Ser24 on Knl1 ( p-Knl1 ) . Remarkably , the ratio of p-Knl1 to CREST signals in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD was more than double that of wild type controls ( Figure 9A ) . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA reduced this to below wild type , an effect unaltered by N54A but largely abolished by T521A T600A ( Figure 9A ) . Similar results were obtained using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser100 on Dsn1 ( data not shown ) and one that detects activating auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A\/B\/C at Thr288 , Thr232 , or Thr198 ( p-Aurora ) , respectively ( Figure 9B ) . Interestingly , these effects were specific to kinetochores as auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B\/C on chromosome arms was unaltered in the mutant oocytes ( Figure 9B ) . Importantly , Sgol2 did not alter the overall amount of Aurora C at kinetochores ( Figure 10 ) . These results imply that Sgol2 counters phosphorylation of KMN network proteins by a mechanism not involving its recruitment of PP2A . Strangely , this process seems to depend on Sgol2\u2019s prior phosphorylation by the very same kinases that it ultimately inhibits . In other words , Aurora B\/C creates its own inhibitor at kinetochores , creating a negative feedback loop . Consistent with this notion , the gradual accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated at T521 following GVBD ( Figure 7B ) is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Dsn1 Ser100 phosphorylation ( Figure 9D ) . Critically , Sgol2\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B\/C kinase activity at kinetochores does not depend on kinetochore-microtubule interactions , as Sgol2 reduced auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B\/C even in the presence of microtubule destabilizing drug ( Figure 9C ) . To address whether hyper-activity of Aurora B\/C at kinetochores could be responsible for the paucity of K-fibers in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes , we tested the effect of the Aurora kinase inhibitor AZD1152 . This both increased the density of K-fibers and reduced kinetochore stretching but did not eliminate lateral attachments ( Figure 8B ) , which may require direct involvement of MCAK . We suggest that Sgol2 promotes chromosome bi-orientation by inhibiting Aurora B\/C kinase as well as by recruiting MCAK . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 024Figure 9 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 025 \n Previous work has shown that Sgol2 is essential for protection of centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al . , 2008; Llano et al . , 2008 ) . Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2\u2019s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism , namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres . PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly , by binding ( Holland et al . , 2007 ) and inhibiting separase activity , or indirectly , by reversing phosphorylation of cohesin\u2019s Rec8 subunit ( Katis et al . , 2010 ) , a process known to be important for its cleavage in yeast . However , if cohesion protection were Sgol2\u2019s sole function , then its depletion should not compromise chromosome segregation during meiosis I . The precocious loss of cohesion should only affect the second meiotic division . On the contrary , depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I . These include inefficient SAC silencing , greatly increased bivalent stretching , and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( K-fibers ) . We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2\u2019s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1 . This raises the possibility that Sgol2 silences the SAC by competing with Cdc20 for the binding of activated Mad2 , thereby preventing formation of the MCC . However , this cannot be the full story as SAC silencing also depends on Sgol2\u2019s ability to bind PP2A . Because Sgol2\u2019s MIM motif is close to the coiled coil by which it binds PP2A , it is conceivable that PP2A directly ( i . e . , structurally ) facilitates the formation or stability of \u2018closed\u2019 complexes between Sgol2 and Mad2 . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only dephosphorylated Mad2 interacts with Cdc20 and Sgol2 , while a phosphomimetic mutant of Mad2 cannot associate with either of these proteins ( personal communication Michael Orth ) . Thus , PP2A could selectively stabilize the Sgol2-Mad2 complex by keeping Mad2 in a de-phosphorylated state . Therefore , it is conceivable that if there were sufficient turnover of Mad2 bound to MCC , then PP2A could promote the Sgol2: Mad2 complex formation and thus alter the activity of the MCC responsible for inhibiting the APC\/C . Unlike centromeric protection and SAC silencing , Sgol2\u2019s regulation of bivalent stretching depends not on its ability to bind PP2A but instead on phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by Aurora B\/C kinases . This facilitates MCAK accumulation at kinetochores . Because artificial recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by fusion to CENP-B substitutes for Sgol2 with regard to bivalent stretching , we suggest that it is the population of MCAK recruited to kinetochores by Sgol2 that moderates the pulling forces exerted on maternal and paternal kinetochores , possibly by reducing the incidence of lateral attachments . Artificial MCAK recruitment did not however restore normal looking end on attachments or greatly facilitate bi-orientation in Sgol2 deficient oocytes , implying that Sgol2 has yet another function at kinetochores besides recruiting PP2A and MCAK . Our observation that auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B\/C kinases as well as phosphorylation of KMN proteins are elevated in Sgol2\u2019s absence but depressed upon microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA suggests that this other function of Sgol2 is to act as a kinetochore-specific inhibitor of Aurora B\/C kinases . The notion that Sgol2 moderates Aurora B\/C kinase activity at kinetochores was unexpected , as it has been reported that xSgo2 , a newly discovered homolog of shugoshin in Xenopus , actually promotes Aurora Kinase activity , generating a favourable environment for microtubule polymerization ( Rivera et al . , 2012 ) . In this case , the effect may be systemic , that is throughout the cytoplasm , whereas M . m Sgol2 appears to act as an inhibitor only at kinetochores . A remarkable feature of this effect is that Sgol2\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B\/C kinases at kinetochores depends on its prior phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by the very same Aurora kinases . In other words , Aurora B\/C kinase creates its own inhibitor , generating a negative feedback loop . Whether the phosphorylation of Sgol2 necessary for it to act as an inhibitor of Aurora kinases at kinetochores is also generated at this location or along chromosome arms or elsewhere in the cell is currently unclear . Irrespective of its precise spatial and dynamic properties , this negative feedback loop may be an important feature of meiosis I . Aurora B\/C protein kinases have a key role in destabilizing inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule attachments , namely those that do not generate tension ( Lampson and Cheeseman , 2011 ) . They are therefore essential for the efficient bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes . However , it is important that the de-stabilization process is eventually turned off so that correctly attached bivalents remain stably attached to microtubules . Hitherto , it has been assumed that the mechanism responsible for turning off these kinases merely involved physical forces that pull Aurora substrates away from the enzymes when maternal and paternal kinetochores are pulled in opposite directions ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Though our work does not preclude a role for traction in down regulating Aurora B\/C\u2019s access to kinetochore-bound substrates , it raises the possibility that down regulation is also an intrinsic feature of a biochemical system in which Aurora B\/C activates its own inhibitor . The regulatory network revealed by our work ensures that Aurora B\/C kinases will be active early during the bi-orientation , when incorrect attachments may be more frequent , and less active later , when they have been largely eliminated . It is possible that during the period when Aurora B\/C kinases are active , the selective stabilization of correct attachments is mediated by mechanical changes within kinetochores induced by tension , as recently observed in purified yeast kinetochores ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ) , not as originally thought by tension dependent changes in Aurora kinase activity , for which there has never been much direct evidence . We suggest that an important feature of meiosis I in oocytes is an early phase of high Aurora B\/C kinase activity at kinetochores followed by a later phase of lowered activity made possible by the Aurora B\/C-Sgol2 negative feedback loop . The lowered activity of Aurora B\/C might increase the MT-depolymerizing activity of MCAK at kinetochores ( Andrews et al . , 2004 ) . This is supported by the fact that the kinetochore pool of MCAK , recruited by Sgol2 , is indeed not phosphorylated at serine 92 in mouse oocytes ( data not shown ) . If correct , it will be important to understand the dynamic properties of the feedback loop that ensures that Aurora B\/C kinases do not turn themselves off precociously . It is currently unclear whether the Aurora B\/C-shugoshin feedback loop is a general feature of meiotic cells or whether it is also a feature of mitotic cells . How Sgol2 inhibits Aurora B\/C kinase activity at kinetochores is also unclear , in particular whether Sgol2 does this alone or only in conjunction with the recruitment of MCAK . Given the number of fundamental processes regulated by Sgol2 , it is surprising that sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes often manage to undergo the first meiotic division without generating massive aneuploidy . Their second meiotic division is of course completely defective due to the total absence of sister chromatid cohesion . We suggest that all of the processes regulated by Sgol2 are fundamentally essential but that they are also regulated by Sgol2-independent pathways . In other words , the processes regulated by Sgol2 may be so fundamental that there are multiple pathways regulating them . It is not inconceivable that Sgol1 , which is also expressed during meiosis , shares some functions with Sgol2 and it will therefore be interesting to analyze the phenotype of double mutant oocytes . What is possibly most remarkable is that a single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion , chromosome traction , the spindle assembly checkpoint , and lastly Aurora B\/C kinases . Crucially , by demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes , we have proven that the pleiotropy observed in sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 oocytes is not due to knock on effects ( secondary or even tertiary pathology ) of eliminating a single function . Sgol2 possesses several different domains that regulate fundamentally different processes ( Figure 11 ) . Why so much regulation is embedded into a single protein is unclear , but we speculate that this helps the coordination of multiple processes necessary for high fidelity chromosome segregation . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 01133 . 026Figure 11 .

To detect Rec8 , females from a transgenic line expressing Rec8 from a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) , with nine tandem copies of the human c-myc epitope at its C terminus , were crossed to sgol2\u0394\/+ males . Litters with genotypes sgol2\u0394\/+ ( Tg ) Rec8- Myc+ were crossed back to sgol2\u0394\/+ mice to generate sgol2\u0394\/+ ( Tg ) Rec8-Myc+ ( controls ) and sgol2\u0394\/\u0394 ( Tg ) Rec8-Myc+ female . Prophase-arrested oocytes were harvested from ovaries excised from 8\u201312 week old female mice . Antral follicles were isolated using sterile insulin needles in M2 medium ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) supplemented with 200 \u00b5M IBMX ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . For intracellular microinjections , oocytes were placed in droplets of M2 medium with IBMX . For time-lapse confocal imaging and in vitro culture prior to preparation of chromosome spreads , oocytes were transferred into IBMX-free M16 medium and cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . Capped mRNA constructs with a poly-A tail were transcribed using T3 or T7 Ultra mMESSAGE kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) from plasmid cDNA encoding H2B-mCherry , wild type Sgol2 ( Origene , Rockville , MD , USA ) , and various mutants of Sgol2 , GFP-Sgol2 , Securin-eGFP , GFP-MCAK , CENPB-eGFP , CENPB-eGFP-MCAK , and GFP-EB3 . Fully-grown oocytes were injected with 5\u201310 pl mRNA at a final concentration of 0 . 1 mg\/ml in RNase-free water ( Ambion ) using a Pneumatic PicoPump ( World Precision Instruments ) . To allow for protein expression , following microinjection of mRNA , GV oocytes were cultured for 12 hr in M16 supplemented with IBMX . Oocytes were then washed in inhibitor-free M16 and thereafter cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . During time-lapse confocal microscopy experiments , oocytes were cultured in a PeCon environmental microscope incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . A Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope equipped with PC-Apochromat 63x\/1 . 2 NA water immersion and PC-Apochromat 20x\/0 . 8 NA objective lenses was used for image acquisition . For detection of GFP and mCherry , 488-nm and 561-nm excitation wavelengths and BP 505\u2013550 and LP 575 filters were used . During live-cell imaging , chromosomes labeled with H2B-mCherry were tracked with an EMBL-developed tracking macro ( Rabut and Ellenberg , 2004 ) adapted to our microscope . We imaged 8 to 16 z-confocal sections ( every 1 . 5 or 2 . 0 \u00b5m ) at 5\u201310 min intervals for 12\u201314 hr . Chromosome spreads from mouse oocytes were prepared as previously described ( Peters et al . , 1997; Hodges and Hunt , 2002 ) . Briefly , zona pellucida was removed by treatment with 10 mg\/ml Pronase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) at 37\u00b0C for 5\u201310 min . Zona-free oocytes were transferred to hypotonic solution ( 50% FCS in deionized water ) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C . Oocytes were then fixed in paraformaldehyde solution ( 1% paraformaldehyde , 0 . 15% Triton X-100 , 3 mM dithiothreitol , adjusted to pH 9 . 2 with NaOH ) in 15-well multichamber glass slide ( MP Biomedicals ) overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber . After drying , slides were washed twice in 0 . 4% Photoflo\/H2O ( Kodak ) and PBS for 5 min , at room temperature . Slides were then processed for immunostaining . In this study , we used CREST ( 1:250; Davis Lab , Davis , CA , USA ) , rabbit anti-Sgol2 serum ( 1:50; gift from JL Barbero [Parra et al . , 2009] ) , anti-phospho T521 Sgol2 ( 1:500 , gift from Yoshi Watanabe [Tanno et al . , 2010] ) , anti-MCAK ( 1:500 , gift from Duane A Compton [Mack and Compton , 2001] ) , anti-phospho S24 Knl1 ( 1:1000 , gift from Iain Cheeseman [Welburn et al . , 2010] ) , anti-phospho S100 Dsn1 ( 1:500 , gift from Iain Cheeseman [Welburn et al . , 2010] ) , antibody detecting T288 , T232 or T198 on Aurora A\/B\/C ( 1:50 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti-Aurora C ( 1:50 , Bethly Laboratories , Montgomery , TX , USA ) , mouse anti-PP2A-C ( 1:200 , BD Biosciences , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) , and anti-c-Myc ( 1:500 , Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . For analysis of K-fibers , oocytes were processed as previously described ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , after either 2 or 6 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were treated for 90 s with Ca2+ buffer ( 100 mM PIPES pH 7:0 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) at 37\u00b0C and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde prepared in Ca2+ buffer for 30 min at room temperature . Following fixation , oocytes were washed and extracted overnight in PBT ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) at 4\u00b0C . Cells were then blocked in 3% BSA with PBT ( blocking solution ) for 1 hr at room temperature . For immuno-labeling oocytes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with \u03b2-tubulin ( 1:250 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) and CREST ( 1:100 , Davis Lab , Davis , CA , USA ) antibodies , prepared in blocking solution . After four washes in PBT , oocytes were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with Alexa 488 and 568 conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:500 , Invitrogen , UK ) prepared in blocking solution . Oocytes were briefly stained with Hoechst 33 , 342 ( 20 mg\/ml ) before confocal imaging . Recombinant MBP-Sgol2cc-His and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were purified from 1l of Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) carrying corresponding expression cassettes in pMAL-c2x- ( Flag-tagged subunit ) and pET28b-based backbones ( His-tagged subunit ) , grown at 37\u00b0C in 2xTY media supplemented with 25 \u03bcg\/ml chloramphenicol and 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin for pMAL-c2x or 50 \u03bcg\/ml kanamycin for pET28b . At OD600 = 0 . 4 , MBP-Sgol2cc-His or -Flag synthesis was induced at 30\u00b0C by the addition of 0 . 1 mM IPTG . After 4 hr , the cells were harvested by centrifugation , frozen in dry ice , and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . The cell paste was re-suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 10% glycerol , 0 . 02% Triton X-100 ) containing Roche complete EDTA free protease inhibitor , 1 mM PMSF and , for the His-tagged subunit 5 mM . Each aliquot was sonicated four times for 30 s on ice . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti-J26XP JLA8 . 1000 rotor . The supernatant was incubated for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C on a 5 ml Talon column ( BD Biosciences , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) or ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel ( Sigma A2220 ) . The M2 Flag beads were washed four times with 50 ml of lysis buffer and the Talon beads were washed two times with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and two times with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 45 mM imidazole . MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag was eluted with four times 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 3 \u00d7 FLAG peptide ( 150 ng\/\u03bcl ) . MBP-Sgol2cc-His was eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M of imidazole . The concentration of MBP-Sgol2cc-His and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were determined by nanodrop against the lysis solution . For all binding assays , highly-purified PP2A subunits ( purified as previously described [Cho and Xu , 2007] ) and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were used . To test the binding of PP2A to mutant shugoshin , 20 \u03bcg of GST-tagged PP2A A subunit were incubated with excess amounts of PP2A B56- and C- subunit and MBP-tagged shugoshin for 1 hr on ice . Subsequently , samples were incubated with 40 \u03bcl of glutathione beads ( GE Healthcare ) for 20 min . Beads were then washed 4 \u00d7 with 1 ml each of 1 \u00d7 PBS , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , boiled in reducing SDS loading buffer , and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining . His and Flag-tagged mSgol2cc from wild type and 3A were co-expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL for 4 hr at 30\u00b0C with 0 . 1 mM of IPTG . Cells were spun at 25 , 000 rpm for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti-J26XP JLA8 . 1000 rotor . The pellet was re-suspended into lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH = 7; 250 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol , 0 . 02% Triton X-100; protease inhibitor ) . 10 mg of extract were incubated with 100 \u03bcl of Talon beads for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C . The beads were wash five times with the lysis buffer containing 23 mM of imidazole . MBP-Sgol2cc-His was eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M of imidazole . Affinity purified material and input were resolved by SDS-PAGE . The abundance of His and Flag-tagged MBP-Sgol2cc were analyzed by western blot using anti-Flag ( 1:10 , 000 ) and anti-His ( 1:10 , 000 ) antibodies .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["chromosomes and gene expression","cell biology"],"id":"elife-01133-v1"}
{"lay_summary":"Microorganisms live in most parts of our body , including the inside of our nose . Most of the microbes are harmless and can even be beneficial to our health . However , some microbes can cause diseases \u2013 although they often go unnoticed , as our immune system can remove them before we show any symptoms . For example , the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis , but generally , it lives harmlessly in the nose , and is particularly common in children and the elderly . The longer the bacteria live in the nose before being killed by the immune system , the more likely they are to be transmitted to another person . The amount of time it takes for the immune system to clear the bacteria depends on various factors , such as the age of the person or the bacterium\u2019s defense mechanism and its genetic material . A particularly important aspect is to what subtype , also known as serotype , a bacterium belongs to , which is characterized by differences in the structure of the sugar coating that surrounds the microbe . However , until now , it was not known how much each of these factors contributes . Now , Lees et al . have developed a mathematical model to calculate how long the bacteria are carried in the nose before they are cleared away , and compared it with the genomic data of the bacteria . For this , over 14 , 000 nose swabs from almost 600 children were collected over a two-year period . In their model , Lees et al . calculated that the bacteria\u2019s genetics explained over 60% of the variability in survival time . They also found that the serotype was the most important individual factor that influenced how long a bacterium could survive . The age of the child was less important and only accounted for 5% . In addition , Lees et al . also found that when viruses infected some S . pneumoniae , the bacteria died sooner . A next step will be to confirm the effect of a viral infection on the bacteria\u2019s survival time in a controlled model system , and also replicate the findings in separate population study . Understanding how long people can carry bacteria and transmit them to others may help to develop new vaccination or treatment strategies to control infections . Moreover , the discovery that viruses can negatively affect how long a bacterium lives , could motivate studies to investigate these findings further .","article":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants , especially in low-income settings . Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease , but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level . Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data , and combined these results with whole genome sequence data . We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation , whereas the host traits considered here ( age and previous carriage ) accounted for less than 5% . We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects , and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype ( 17% ) , drug-resistance ( 9% ) and other significant locus effects ( 7% ) . A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype , potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism . These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance . \n Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that can cause diseases such as pneumonia , otitis media and meningitis . Pneumococcal disease burden is highest in children ( O'Brien et al . , 2009 ) . For disease to be caused pneumococci must first transmit to the host , colonise the nasopharynx and finally cross into a normally sterile site . The pneumococcus spends most of the transmission cycle in the nasopharynx , and so understanding and predicting the amount of time spent in this niche is critical for understanding this bacterium's epidemiology , and therefore controlling transmission ( Abdullahi et al . , 2012a; Melegaro et al . , 2007 ) . The nasopharynx is a complex niche in which each pneumococcal genotype must tackle a wide range of factors including host immune defence ( McCool et al . , 2002 ) , other bacterial species ( Pericone et al . , 2000 ) , and other pneumococcal lineages ( Auranen et al . , 2010; Cobey and Lipsitch , 2012 ) in order to maintain the genotype's population . The average nasopharyngeal duration period is therefore affected by a large number of factors , which may , themselves , interact . One factor that is known to strongly associate with carriage duration is serotype: as capsular polysaccharides are important in bacterial physiology and determining host immune response , different serotypes have different clearance and acquisition rates ( Abdullahi et al . , 2012a; Hill et al . , 2010; H\u00f6gberg et al . , 2007; Melegaro et al . , 2004;\u00a0Turner et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , a range of other proteins have been identified as critical to the colonisation process ( Kadioglu et al . , 2008 ) , some of which exhibit similar levels of diversity to the capsule polysaccharide synthesis locus ( Iannelli et al . , 2002; Jedrzejas et al . , 2001 ) . However , the overall and relative contributions of these sequence variations to carriage rate have not yet been characterised . In addition variation of pathogen protein sequence , accessory genes and interaction effects between genetic elements may also have as yet unknown effects on carriage duration . Changes in average carriage duration have been shown to be linked with recombination rate ( Chaguza et al . , 2016 ) , which has been found to correlate with antibiotic resistance ( Hanage et al . , 2009 ) and invasive potential ( Chaguza et al . , 2016 ) . The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology , and consequently is important in evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) ( Melegaro et al . , 2007; Weinberger et al . , 2011 ) . Additionally , modelling work has proposed that if alleles exist which alter carriage duration , these explain the long standing puzzle of how antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains stably coexist in the population ( Lehtinen et al . , 2017 ) . Measurement of carriage duration and the analysis of its variance beyond the resolution of serotype will have important consequences for these models . We sought to determine the overall importance of the pathogen genotype in carriage duration in a human population , and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration . By combining epidemiological modelling of longitudinal swab data with and genome wide association study methods on the connected sequences ( Figure 1 ) , we made heritability estimates for carriage duration . We further partitioned the heritability into contributions from lineage and locus effects ( Earle et al . , 2016 ) to quantify the variation caused by each individual factor . \n We first estimated carriage duration from longitudinal swab data available for the study population . For 598 unvaccinated children up to 24 swabs taken over a two year period were available , an extension on the previous study ( Turner et al . , 2012 , 2013a ) . We only considered swabs from infants in the study , as mothers did not have sufficient sampling resolution relative to their average length of carriage to determine carriage duration . Furthermore , the immune response of mothers to bacterial pathogens is different to children ( Mar\u00f3di , 2006 ) , leading to shorter carriage durations ( Gritzfeld et al . , 2014 ) . To estimate carriage duration from the longitudinal swab data we constructed a set of hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) with hidden states corresponding to whether a child was carrying a serotype at a given time point , and observed states corresponding to whether a positive swab was observed for this serotype at this time point . The most general model for the swab data would be a vector with an entry of 0 or 1 for every possible serotype ( of 56 observed in the population ) , corresponding to whether each serotype was observed in the swab at each time point . However , the number of parameters to estimate in this model ( with over 6 million states ) is much larger than the number of data points ( around 14000 ) , and in particular some serotypes have very few positive observations . Instead , we modelled each serotype separately . The models fitted , and their permitted transitions and emissions are shown in Figure 2 . In model one , observation i emits state 2 if positively swabbed for the serotype , and state 1 otherwise . The unobserved states correspond to the child \u2018carrying\u2019 and being \u2018clear\u2019 of the serotype respectively . We assume swabs have a specificity of one , so do not show positive culture when the child is clear of the carried serotype; we therefore set the coefficient for the chance of observing positive culture when no bacteria are present to zero ( e21=0 in the emission matrix ) . Model two adds a third state of \u2018multiple carriage\u2019 which is occupied when the serotype and at least one other are being carried . Both models were compared with a version which allows the parameters to covary with whether the child has carried pneumococcus previously . Model three accounts for this explicitly by having separate states and emissions based on whether carriage has previously been observed . We applied all the models to 19F carriage episodes , as these had the most data available , and calculated the Akaike information criterion ( Akaike , 1974 ) for each model that converged . Only the simplest model ( model one ) converged , as judged by having a positive-definite Hessian and a converged BOBYQA run . The more complex models had lower log-likelihoods: as extensions of the simpler model they should have higher log-likelihoods , so this results was not consistent with model convergence . We tried fitting models two and three using a fixed false positive values slightly greater than zero , this lead to better log-likelihoods , but the models still didn\u2019t converge . This failure of the more complex models is probably because most children in the study immediately enter the carrying state , and episodes of dual carriage ( when split up by serotype ) are rare . Therefore there were not enough events between these carriage states to estimate to the transition and emission intensities , without sensitivity to initial conditions during the fitting . We then fitted the best performing model in this test for all serotypes separately . 6A and 6C were treated as a single serotype , as they were not always distinguished in the course of the study . The models for 19F , 23F , 6A\/C , 6B , 14 and non-typable ( NT ) converged , but other serotypes did not have enough observations to successfully fit the parameters of the model . For these less prevalent serotypes we used the transition and emission parameters from the 19F model fitted with the correct observations when reconstructing the most likely route taken through the hidden states . Results were inspected to ensure this did not cause systematic overestimation when compared with previous studies . We found that the fit for NT swabs produced results which overestimated carriage duration when compared to previously reported estimates . The best fit to the model overestimated the e21 parameter , which measures the false negative rate of swabbing , in favour of reduced transition intensities . We therefore fitted the model again , fixing this rate at 0 . 12 . We based this figure on non-typable Streptococcus pneumoniae abundance as defined by 16S survey sequencing . At 1% proportional abundance in the sample , 12% came out as culture negative ( Table 1 ) . From all the swab data , we estimated that there were a total of 4382 carriage episodes ( 7 . 3 per child ) , of which 2254 had a complete set of AMR data available ( Figure\u00a03 ) . After removing ten outlier observations from swabs taken accidentally during disease , we were able to match 2157 sequenced genomes with a carriage duration . Duration was positively skewed due to some observations of very long carriage times . We therefore took a monotonic transform of the carriage duration using warped-lmm to maximise the study's power to discover associations and estimate heritability ( Figure 3 ) . This uses a sum over three nonlinear step functions , plus a linear term , to transform the residuals into Gaussians ( Snelson et al . , 2004 ) . The variation in carriage duration \u03c3P2 is partly caused by variance in pneumococcal genetics , and variance in other potentially unknown factors such as host age and host genetics . It is common to write this sum as two components: genetic effects \u03c3G2 and environmental effects \u03c3E2 . The proportion of the overall variation which can be explained by the genetics of the bacterium is known as the broad-sense heritability H2=\u03c3G2\u03c3G2+\u03c3E2 . Variants which are directly associated with carriage duration independently of other variants ( non-epistatic effects ) contribute to the narrow-sense heritability h2 , which is smaller than the overall broad-sense heritability ( Visscher et al . , 2008 ) . H2 can be estimated by linear regression on the phenotype of donor-recipient pairs which nearly share their genetics ( Fraser et al . , 2014 ) . However in this dataset we were only able to confidently identify five transmission events , which was not enough to apply this method . Alternatively , analysis of variance of the phenotype between pathogens with similar genetics can be used to estimate heritability ( Anderson et al . , 2010 ) . By applying this to phylogenetically similar bacteria ( Figure\u00a04 ) , we estimated that H2=0 . 634 ( 95% CI 0 . 592\u20130 . 686 ) . This implies that the genetics of S . pneumoniae is an important factor in determining carriage duration in this population . If environmental conditions are associated with streptococcal genotype between populations ( such as host vaccination status ) the heritability estimate may differ . A lower bound on h2 can be calculated by fitting a linear mixed model through maximum likelihood to common SNPs ( hSNP2 ) ( Lee et al . , 2011; Manolio et al . , 2009 ) . We used the model in warped-lmm ( Fusi et al . , 2014 ) to estimate hSNP2 for carriage duration data , yielding an estimate of 0 . 445 , consistent with our estimate for H2 . After calculating the overall heritability , we wished to determine the amount that the specific variation in the pathogen genome contributes to changing carriage duration . In the context of genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) in bacteria strong linkage-disequilibrium ( LD ) is present across the entire genome , making it difficult to pinpoint variants associated with carriage duration and not just present in the background of longer or shorter carried lineages ( Chen and Shapiro , 2015 ) . In S . pneumoniae , serotype and antibiogram are correlated with the overall genome sequence ( Brueggemann et al . , 2003; Chewapreecha et al . , 2014a; Enright and Spratt , 1998 ) . If these factors are associated with carriage duration , large sets of variants which define long-carried and short-carried lineages will be correlated with carriage duration in a naive association test ( Chen and Shapiro , 2015; Read and Massey , 2014 ) . A distinction has therefore been made between variants which evolve convergently and affect a phenotype independently of lineage \u2013 termed locus effects \u2013 to those which are collinear with a genotype which is associated with the phenotype , termed lineage effects ( Earle et al . , 2016 ) . Locus effects may be associated with a change in carriage duration due to convergent evolution ( which may occur through recombination between lineages ) . In such regions , the causal loci and corresponding phenotypic effects are easier to identify ( Power et al . , 2017 ) . Linear mixed models can be used to find these variants which are associated with a bacterial phenotype independent of lineage; discovery of homoplasic and polygenic variation associated with the phenotype across the entire tree is well powered ( Earle et al . , 2016 ) . While the high heritability suggests many pathogen variants do affect carriage duration , it does not give information on how many of these will be locus or lineage effects . We mapped carriage duration onto the phylogeny , reconstructing the ancestral state at each node . Consistent with the high heritability of carriage duration we found that carriage length was clearly stratified by lineage ( Figure\u00a04 ) : we calculated Pagel\u2019s lambda as 0 . 56 ( p<10-10 ) . We also modelled the evolution of carriage duration along the tree using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model , and found that lineage genetics was significantly correlated with the trait ( LRT\u00a0=\u00a0952; p<10-10 ) We first tested for the association of serotype with carriage duration using lasso regression and with a linear-mixed model ( LMM ) . Serotype is correlated with sequence type ( Croucher et al . , 2011 ) and has previously been associated with differences in carriage duration ( Abdullahi et al . , 2012a; Turner et al . , 2012 ) . We also included resistance to six antibiotics , the causal element to some of which are known to be associated with specific lineages ( Lees et al . , 2016 ) . These are therefore possible lineage effects which would be unlikely to be found associated under a model which adjusts for population structure ( Chen and Shapiro , 2015 ) . Not all serotypes and resistances may have an effect on carriage duration , or there may not be enough carriage episodes observed to reach significance . As including extra predictors in a linear regression always increases the variance explained , we first performed variable selection using lasso regression ( Efron et al . , 2004 ) to obtain a more reliable estimate of the amount of variation explained . Where a resistance and serotype are correlated and both associated with a change in carriage duration , this will produce a robust selection of the predictors ( Hebiri and Lederer , 2012 ) . The selected predictors and their effect on carriage duration are shown in Table\u00a02 . The total variance explained by these lineage factors was 0 . 19 , 0 . 178 for serotype alone and 0 . 092 for resistance alone . When we used genomic partitioning of variance components these were instead estimated to be 0 . 253 , 0 . 135 and 0 . 113 , respectively . We applied the covariance test ( Lockhart et al . , 2014 ) to determine which lineage effects were significantly associated with carriage duration and found that 19F , erythromycin resistance , 23F , 6B caused significant ( \u03b1<0 . 05 ) increase in carriage duration and being non-typable caused a significant decrease . Previous studies have used isogenic strains to look for effects of serotype of colonisation and carriage duration independent of genetic background . Resistance to killing ( Weinberger et al . , 2009 ) , growth phenotype ( Hathaway et al . , 2012 ) and resistance to complement ( Melin et al . , 2010 ) have all been shown to affect carriage through serotype rather than genetic background . Conversely , some bacterial genetic variation has been shown to be able to affect colonisation independent of serotype ( Khan et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore wished to test whether the detected effect of serotype and resistance on carriage duration was entirely mediated through their covariance with lineage , or whether they are independently associated with carriage duration . We first looked for differences in duration over three recent capsule gain\/loss events; if there is an effect of serotype independent of genetic background , these would be predicted have the largest difference between serotypes while controlling for the relatedness of isolates . No significant difference in duration was seen between isolates with or without capsule within the same lineage ( p=0 . 39; Figure\u00a04 ) . However , as these events were limited in number , assumed genetic independence within the clade and occurred only in part of the population , we also performed the same regression as above while also including lineage ( defined by discrete population clusters ) as a predictor . This therefore allows serotypes which appear in different population clusters to distinguish whether lineage or serotype had a greater effect on carriage duration . The covariance test found that 19F , erythromycin resistance and being non-typable had significant effects on the model ( in that order ) . As these terms enter the model before any lineage specific effect , this suggested these serotypes and resistances are associated with variation in carriage duration independent of background genotype This lasso-based analysis may be vulnerable to confounding from unmeasured variables which may be associated with the explanatory variables ( serotype and resistance ) . To fully account for the effect of the bacterial genome rather than relying on discrete clusters as covariates in the regression , we performed regression of these lineage effects under an LMM where the relatedness between strains was instead included as a random effect . The predictors had the same order of significance , but only serotype 19F reached genome-wide significance ( p=3 . 8\u00d710\u22127 ) . Together , this suggests that the main lineage effect on carriage duration is the serotype , but only some serotypes ( 19F ) have an association independent of genetic background . We also found that erythromycin resistance may be significantly associated with an increased carriage duration . While being a relatively uncommon treatment in this setting ( 3% of treatments captured ) , we did not find that other antibiotics were associated . This may be because erythromycin resistance would be expected to cause an almost four order magnitude increase in minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , whereas other resistance acquisitions have a much smaller effect . Additionally , we calculated the mean sojourn times ( average length of time children are expected to remain in the carrying state of the model with the given serotype ) and mean number of carriage episodes from the fit to the HMM for commonly carried serotypes ( ) , which gave results similar to the regression performed above . These estimates are comparable to the previous analysis on a subset of these samples . The majority of carriage episodes were due to five of the seven paediatric serotypes ( Shapiro and Austrian , 1994 ) , or non-typeable isolates . The results show 19F , 23F and 14 were carried the longest , 6A\/C and 6B for intermediate lengths , and NT the shortest . The overall picture of the first two years of infant carriage is one containing one or two long ( over 90 day ) carriage episodes of a common serotype ( 6A\/C , 6B , 14 , 19F , 23F ) and around two short ( under a month ) carriage episodes of non-typable S . pneumoniae . Colonisation by other serotypes seem to cause slightly shorter carriage episodes , though the relative rarity of these events naturally limits the confidence in this inference . That some serotypes are rarer and carried for shorter time periods may be evidence of competitive exclusion ( Hardin , 1960; Trzci\u0144ski et al . , 2015 ) , as fitter serotypes quickly replace less fit serotypes thus leading to reduced carriage duration . The calculated mean carriage duration of NT pneumococci is similar to the minimum resolution we were able to measure by the study design , which suggests carriage episodes may actually be shorter than one month . Unfortunately the only existing study with higher resolution did not check for colonisation by NT pneumococci ( Abdullahi et al . , 2012a ) . These estimates are similar to previous longitudinal studies in different populations ( Hill et al . , 2010; H\u00f6gberg et al . , 2007; Melegaro et al . , 2007 ) , though against the Kilifi study our estimates are systematically larger . This may be due to the lower resolution swabbing we performed , or may be because the previous study was unable to resolve multiple carriage ( 11% of positive swabs ) . While our heritability estimates are specific to this population due to differences in host , vaccine deployment and transmission dynamics , the similarity of the estimates of serotype effect to those from different study populations suggests our results may be somewhat generalisable . To search for locus effects as discussed above , we applied an LMM to all the common SNPs and k-mers in the dataset . The results for SNPs are shown in Figure 5 and Table 4 , with 14 loci reaching suggestive significance and two reaching genome-wide significance ( top hit \u03b2=0 . 17; p=2 . 1\u00d710\u22127; MAF = 1% ) . We also found that 424 k-mers reached genome-wide significance ( top hit \u03b2=0 . 11; p=2 . 1\u00d710\u221212; MAF = 2% ) , which we filtered to 321 k-mers over 20 bases long to remove low specificity sequences ( Figure 5 ) . To determine their function , we mapped these k-mers to the coordinates of reference sequences . The only genome-wide significant SNP hits are synonymous changes ( MAF\u00a0=\u00a01% ) in the replication module of the prophage in the ATCC 700669 genome ( Croucher et al . , 2009 ) , a highly variable component of the pneumococcal genome ( Croucher et al . , 2014a ) ( Figure\u00a05 ) . The LD structure suggested there were two separate significant signals found in this region . We therefore performed another GWAS conditioning on the top hit to test if there was a second independent signal , but found that the second hit in this region was no longer significant ( position 1526024; p=2 . 2\u00d710-4 ) . The current data is therefore consistent with only a single significant hit to prophage . The most significant k-mer hits were also located in phage sequence ( MAF 2% ) and were associated with a reduced duration of carriage . As these mobile genetic elements are less weakly population stratified than other regions of the genome , they are easier to find as locus effects . The LD in this region is less than in the rest of the genome , as prophage sequence is highly variable within S . pneumoniae lineages ( Croucher et al . , 2014a ) . Multiple independent phage variants may therefore affect carriage duration , which will increase their significance using a LMM . Indeed , the significant results from the LMM ( top SNP p=2 . 1\u00d710-7; top k-mer p=2 . 1\u00d710-12 ) are not significant ( top SNP p=5 . 1\u00d710-6; top k-mer p=5 . 7\u00d710-8 ) under a model of association using a linear regression with the first 30 principal components as fixed effects to control for population structure rather than random effects , and are strongly associated with the population structure components of the model ( highest association p=5 . 2\u00d710-75 with PC 2 ) . We postulated that presence of any phage in the genome may cause a reduction in carriage duration . By using the presence of phage as a trait under the same linear mixed model , we however found no evidence of association when correcting for population structure ( p=0 . 35 ) . These results are therefore evidence that infection with a specific phage sequence is associated with a slight decrease in carriage duration . A similar result has previously been found in a genome-wide screen in Neisseria meningitidis , where a specific phage sequence was found to affect the virulence and epidemiology of strains ( Bille et al . , 2005; Bille et al . , 2008 ) . Additionally , previous in vivo tests have shown phage elements to cause a fitness decrease of S . pneumoniae during carriage ( DeBardeleben et al . , 2014 ) . The genetic polymorphisms in the prophage associated with changes in carriage duration , found in 2% of viral sequences , are found within coding sequences inside the phage replication module ( Romero et al . , 2009 ) . It is unlikely the specific variants of these proteins cause a significant difference in cell phenotype , because they are only highly expressed after the prophage is activated , and cell lysis is typically imminent . One explanation for these results is that a subpopulation of prophage do not cause a significant decrease in their host bacterium's carriage duration , which could be due to beneficial \u2018cargo\u2019 genes . Yet previous surveys of pneumococcal prophage have found little evidence of these elements carrying such sequences ( Croucher et al . , 2014a; Romero et al . , 2009 ) . One phage protein that has been found to alter the bacterial phenotype is PblB , a phage structural protein that can also mediate bacterial adhesion to human cells ( Loeffler and Fischetti , 2006 ) . However , pblB is within the morphology module ( Romero et al . , 2009 ) and as an adhesin might be expected to increase carriage duration . Hence the detected association is unlikely to represent expression of viral machinery or cargo genes in the host cell while the prophage is dormant . Alternatively , the association with only a subset of prophage may be the consequence of sampling . Using a monthly swabbing approach , it was only possible to robustly infer changes in the carriage duration of genotypes that colonise hosts for long periods . Therefore any prophage locus that enhances a virus\u2019 ability to infect long carriage duration pneumococci may have an elevated correlation with the variation in the observed phenotype . As phage commonly exhibit high levels of strain specificity ( Duplessis and Moineau , 2001 ) , this is a plausible mechanism , although the role of the replication module in such host preference is unclear . An additional mechanism by which prophage can affect host phenotype is by inserting into , and thereby disrupting , functional genes . Pneumococcal prophage frequently insert into comYC , thereby preventing the host cell undergoing transformation ( Croucher et al . , 2011; Croucher et al . , 2014b ) . Using previous categorisation of the comYC gene in this collection into intact versus interrupted or missing ( Croucher et al . , 2016 ) , we found that having an intact comYC gene ( 23% of isolates ) was significantly associated with an increased carriage duration using the LMM ( \u03b2=0 . 29;\u00a0p=1 . 4\u00d710\u221244 ) . The effect size is similar to the associated phage k-mers , but has at a higher allele frequency ( hence the increased significance of the result ) . An interpretation consistent with these findings would be that the effect of phage k-mers is actually through interrupting comYC . The k-mers themselves were spread out to lower frequencies due to their sequence variability , and no references used allowed mapping to find the comYC interruption directly . Signals at the suggestive level include pbp1a and pbp2b , which suggest as above that penicillin resistance may slightly increase carriage duration , but there are not enough samples in this analysis to confirm or refute this . Other signals near genes at a suggestive level included SNPs in trcF ( transcription coupled DNA repair ) , padR ( repressor of phenolic acid stress response ) , pepS ( aminopeptidase ) , aroA ( aromatic amino acid synthesis ) , fms ( peptide deformylase ) and a thioesterase superfamily protein . K-mers from erythromycin resistance genes ( ermB , mel , mef ) were expected to reach significance from the above analysis , but did not: it has however previously been shown that the power to detect these elements in a larger sample set taken from the same population is limited due to the multiple resistance mechanisms and stratification of resistance with lineage ( Lees et al . , 2016 ) . The test statistic from fast-lmm roughly followed the null-hypothesis , with the exception of the significant phage k-mers ( Figure\u00a05 ) . However there is limited power to detect effects associated with both the lineage and phenotype . This effect has been previously noted , and while LMMs have improved power for detecting locus specific effects they lose power when detecting associated variants which segregate with background genotype ( Earle et al . , 2016 ) . To search for candidate regions which may be independently associated with both a lineage and increased carriage duration , we ran an association test using a set number of fixed effects as the population structure correction . This is expected to have higher power than an LMM for true associated variants on ancestral branches , but will also increase the number of false positives ( variants co-occurring on these branches which do not directly affect the carriage duration themselves ) . We also tested SNPs for their association with those principal components which were themselves significantly associated with carriage duration , and therefore may be driving the lineage associations ( Earle et al . , 2016 ) . The most highly associated SNPs were in all three pbp regions associated with \u03b2-lactam resistance , the capsule locus , recA ( DNA repair and homologous recombination ) , bgaA ( beta-galactosidase ) , phoH-like protein ( phosphate starvation-inducible protein ) , ftsZ ( cell division protein ) and groEL ( chaperonin ) . As 19F , the serotype most associated with carriage duration , is predominantly the \u03b2-lactam resistant PMEN14 lineage the pbp association may be driven through strong LD between with this serotype . Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 shows the analysis of SNPs which may be driving significant lineage associations \u2013 this also suggested dnaB ( DNA replication ) may be associated with altered carriage duration . Associated k-mers were also found in phtD ( host cell surface adhesion ) , mraY ( cell wall biosynthesis ) , tlyA ( rRNA methylase ) , zinT ( zinc recruitment ) , adcA ( zinc recruitment ) and recJ ( DNA repair ) . Additionally we found k-mers in the bacteriocin blpZ and immunity protein pncM ( Bogaardt et al . , 2015 ) to be associated with variability in carriage duration . This could be evidence that intra-strain competition occurs within host via this mechanism , consistent with previous in vitro mouse models ( Dawid et al . , 2007 ) . It is not possible to determine whether variation in these genes is associated with a change in carriage duration or if the variation is present in longer carried , generally more prevalent lineages . For example , \u03b2-lactam resistance may appear associated as the long carried lineages 19F and 23F are more frequently resistant , or it may genuinely provide an advantage in the nasopharynx that extends carriage duration independent of other factors . Future studies of carriage duration , or further experimental evidence will be needed to determine which is the case for these regions . Antigenic variation in known regions ( of pspA , pspC , zmpA or zmpB ) may be expected to cause a change in carriage duration ( Lipsitch and O'Hagan , 2007 ) , however we found none of these to be associated with a change in carriage duration . This was likely due to stratification of variation in these regions with lineage , but may also be caused by a larger diversity of k-mers in the region reducing power to detect an association . Finally , we wished to determine the importance of two environmental factors which are known to contribute to variance in this phenotype: child age and whether the carriage episode is the first the child has been exposed to ( Abdullahi et al . , 2012a; Abdullahi et al . , 2012b; Turner et al . , 2012 ) . These have been applied throughout the analysis as covariates , both in the estimation of carriage episodes and in associating genetic variation with change in carriage duration . We applied linear regression to these factors while using the first 30 PCs to correct for the effect of the bacterial genome , which showed they were both significantly associated with carriage duration as expected ( age p=3 . 9\u00d710-7; previous carriage p=2 . 5\u00d710-8 ) . Using the linear mixed model to control for bacterial genotype both factors were again significant ( LRT\u00a0=\u00a026 . 4; p=1 . 8\u00d710-6 ) . Together , they explained 0 . 046 of variation in carriage duration . As found previously , increasing child age contributes to a decrease in the duration of carriage episodes . From a mean of 68 days long , we calculated a drop of 19 days after a year , and 32 days after two years . Extrapolating , this causes carriage episodes longer than two days to cease by age 11 ( Figure\u00a06 ) . Previous carriage of any serotype was estimated to cause an increase in the duration of future carriage episodes , though previous studies have found no overall effect ( Weinberger et al . , 2008 ) . It has previously been shown that prior exposure to non-typables in this cohort make colonisation by another non-typable occur later , and for a shorter time ( Turner et al . , 2012 ) . The positive effect observed in this analysis is therefore likely to be an artefact due to subsequent carriage episodes being more likely to be due to typable pneumococci . Additional environmental factors that explain some of the remainder of the variance may include the variation of the host immune response and interaction with other infections or co-colonisation . In particular , co-infection influenza A was not recorded but is known to affect population dynamics within the nasopharynx ( Kono et al . , 2016 ) . Fundamentally , imprecise inference of the carriage duration will limit our ability to fully explain its variance . \n Other than serotype , the genetic determinants of pneumococcal carriage duration were previously unknown . By developing models for longitudinal swab data and combining the results with whole genome sequence data we have quantified and mapped the genetic contribution to the carriage duration of S . pneumoniae . We found that despite a range of other factors such as host age which are known to cause carriage duration to differ , sequence variation of the pneumococcal genome explains most of this variability ( 63% ) . Common serotypes and resistance to erythromycin cause some of this effect ( 19% total ) , as does the presence or absence of particular prophage sequence in the genome . Table\u00a05 summarise the sources we found to be significantly associated with variation in carriage duration . We provide a quantitative estimate of how closely transmission pairs share their carriage duration , and show evidence for differences both between and within serotypes . The implication of phage as having a significant effect on carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage , even during carriage episodes in this dataset . Investigating a mechanism for the prophage association , we found that having an intact comYC gene , which is frequently interrupted by prophage causing loss of function of the competence system , was associated with increased carriage duration . While the competence system is observed to remain intact over the evolutionary history of the species , these disruptive mutations spread irreversibly through the population as competent bacteria can acquire the mutation , and non-competent bacteria can no longer reverse it through recombination ( Croucher et al . , 2014b ) . Selection must therefore maintain the function at this locus over short timescales , and an increased carriage duration may be evidence of this . We therefore hypothesise that the associated prophage sequences may affect carriage duration through disruption of the competence system , without which deleterious mutations will accumulate in the population due to Muller's ratchet . The results presented here have important implications for the modelling of pneumococcal transmission and their response to perturbation of the population by vaccine . Importantly , our analysis of heritability shows that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration , consistent with recent theoretical work ( Lehtinen et al . , 2017 ) . Here we have shown that these alleles do exist in a natural population , and also identified candidates for the loci which fulfil this role . Together these studies suggest that variants exist in the pneumococcal genome which alter carriage duration , which in turn is linked to antibiotic resistance . We were not able to fully explain the basis for heritability of carriage duration for a number of reasons . The close association of the phenotype with lineage limited our power to fine-map lineage associated variants other than capsule type which may affect carriage duration . Meta-analysis with more large studies with higher resolution may help to resolve these issues: we are conducting a similar study in Cape Town , South Africa which will combine sequence data with two-weekly swabs and will be compared to these results in future . Additional environmental factors that explain some of the remainder of the variance may include the variation of the host immune response and interaction with other infections or co-colonisation . In particular , co-infection with influenza A was not recorded but is known to affect population dynamics within the nasopharynx ( Kono et al . , 2016 ) . This is a phenotype which would have been difficult to assay by traditional methods such as in an animal model due to the cohort size needed and the length of time experiments would need to be run for . By instead using genome-wide association study methods we have been able to quantitatively investigate a complex phenotype in a natural population . We believe that the analysis of heritability and variance explained in a phenotype of interest , as presented here , will be an important part analysis of complex bacterial traits in future studies . \n The study population was a subset of infants from the Maela longitudinal birth cohort ( Turner et al . , 2013a ) , and was split into two cohorts . In the \u2018routine\u2019 cohort , 364 infants were swabbed monthly from birth , 24 times in total . All swabs were cultured and serotyped using the latex sweep method ( Turner et al . , 2013b ) . In the \u2018immunology\u2019 cohort 234 infants were swabbed on the same time schedule , but cultured and serotyped following the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) method ( Turner et al . , 2012 ) . Non-typable pneumococci were confirmed by bile solubility , optochin susceptibility and Omniserum Quellung negative . For both cohorts phenotypic drug resistance to six antibiotics was available ( chloramphenicol , \u03b2-lactams , clindamycin , erythromycin , trimethoprim and tetracycline ) . 3161 randomly selected pneumococcal positive swabs from the study population have been previously sequenced , 2175 of which were from these longitudinal infant samples ( Chewapreecha et al . , 2014a ) . Latex sweeps could not differentiate 6A and 6C serotypes , so we treated these as a single serotype when detected by this method ( in WHO serotyping PCR was used to differentiate these serotypes ) . 15B and 15C serotypes spontaneously interconvert , so were combined . We removed two duplicated swabs ( 08B09098 from the immunology cohort; 09B02164 from the routine observation cohort ) . To get a good fit of the HMM , we normalised observation times for each sample . Defining infant birth as t=0 , subsequent sampling times ti were measured in days , and normalised to have a variance of one . The actual ( untransformed ) carriage duration in days was used as initial phenotype y . We modelled the time series of swab data using a continuous-time HMM , as implemented in the R package msm ( RRID:SCR_015500 ) ( Jackson , 2011 ) . Unobserved ( true ) states correspond to whether the child is carrying bacteria in their nasopharynx , and observed ( emitted ) states correspond to whether a positive swab was seen at each point . Transition probabilities between each state Q and the emission probabilities E are jointly estimated by maximum likelihood using the BOBYQA algorithm . We then constructed the most likely path through the unobserved states for each child using the Viterbi algorithm ( Forney , 1973 ) with the observed data and estimated model parameters . Assuming that continuous occupation of the carried state corresponded to a single carriage episode , we calculated the duration for each such episode from the inferred true states . For each isolate with an inferred carriage duration ( N\u00a0=\u00a02175 ) we extracted SNPs from the previously generated alignment against the ATCC 700669 genome ( Chewapreecha et al . , 2014b ) . Consequences of SNPs were annotated with VEP ( RRID:SCR_007931 ) , using a manually prepared reference ( McLaren et al . , 2010 ) . A phylogenetic tree was generated from this alignment using FastTree ( RRID:SCR_015501 ) under the GTR\u00a0+gamma model ( Price et al . , 2009 ) . The carriage duration was mapped on to this phylogeny using phytools ( RRID:SCR_015502 ) ( Revell , 2013 ) . We then filtered the sites in the alignment to remove any where the major allele was an N , any sites with a minor allele frequency lower than 1% , and any sites where over 5% of calls were missing . This left 115210 sites for association testing and narrow-sense heritability estimation . We counted 68M non-redundant k-mers with lengths 9\u2013100 from the de novo assemblies of the genomes using a distributed string mining algorithm ( Seth et al . , 2014; V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki and Puglisi , 2012 ) . We filtered out low frequency variants removing any k-mers with a minor allele frequency below 2% , leaving 17M for association testing . We identified the presence of phage by performing a blastn of the de novo assemblies against a reference database of phage sequence ( Croucher et al . , 2016 ) . If the length of the top hit was over 5000 we defined the isolate as having phage present ( Figure\u00a05 ) . As we aimed to fit a multiple linear regression model to the carriage duration y at each genetic locus k , we first ensured the data was appropriate for this model . The phenotype distribution was positively skewed , with an approximately exponential distribution ( Figure\u00a03 ) . Residuals were therefore non-normally distributed , potentially reducing power ( McCulloch , 2003 ) . In the regression setting , a monotonic function can be applied to transform the response variable to avoid this problem . We took the natural logarithm of the carriage duration\ud835\udc32^=ln\u2062 ( \ud835\udc32 ) which led to the residuals being much closer to being normally distributed ( Figure\u00a03 ) . We applied the same transformation to child age , when it was used as a covariate in association . We estimated broad sense heritability H2 with the ANOVA-CPP method in the patherit R package ( Mitov and Stadler , 2016 ) , using a patristic distance cutoff of 0 . 04 ( Figure\u00a04 ) . To test the effect of lineage genetics we used the patherit package to fit an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of the warped carriage duration along the phylogeny . We compared the likelihood of the full fit to that with no genetic effect on the trait ( \u03c3G2=0 ) using a likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) with one degree of freedom . To estimate the SNP-based heritability hSNP2 we applied a linear mixed model , which uses the genomic relatedness matrix ( as calculated from SNPs passing filtering ) as random effects . We used the implementation in warped-lmm ( RRID:SCR_015503 ) ( Fusi et al . , 2014 ) , which learns a monotonic transform as it fits the model to the data to ensure residuals are normally distributed ( Figure\u00a03 ) . We therefore used the untransformed phenotype y as the input . Child age and whether previous carriage had occurred were included as covariates . We also estimated hSNP2 using LDAK ( RRID:SCR_015504 ) ( Speed et al . , 2012 ) with default settings , which gave an estimate of 0 . 437 ( <1% difference from the warped-lmm estimate ) . We encoded all 56 observed serotypes ( including non-typables ) and resistance to the six antibiotics as dummy variables . We used 6A\/C as the reference level , as this had a mean carriage duration close to the grand mean in previous analysis . Orthogonal polynomial coding was used for the latter four antibiotics , where resistance could be intermediate or full . We then regressed this design matrix X was against the transformed carriage duration \ud835\udc32^ . We removed three observations with low carriage lengths due to a delayed initial swab , and seven observations with leverages of one ( Figure\u00a03 ) . We performed variable selection using lasso regression ( Efron et al . , 2004 ) , implemented in the R package glmnet ( RRID:SCR_015505 ) ( Friedman et al . , 2010 ) . We used leave-one-out cross-validation to choose a value for the \u21131 penalty; the value one standard error above the minimum cross-validated error ( Tibshirani et al . , 2001 ) was selected ( \u03bb=0 . 033; Figure\u00a04 ) . The 20 predictors with non-zero coefficients in the model at this value of \u03bb ( Table 2 ) were used in a linear regression to calculate the multiple R2 , which corresponds to the proportion of variance explained by these predictors . To estimate the variance components from serotype and resistance we used genomic partitioning ( Yang et al . , 2011 ) , as implemented in LDAK . We used SNPs in the capsule locus to calculate a kinship matrix approximating the contribution from serotype variation . For antibiotic resistance we used SNPs in the pbp genes , dyr gene and ICE transposon to calculate a kinship matrix . Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate the variance explained by each of these components . Capsule switch events had been previously identified by first reconstructing of the ancestral state of the serotype at each node through maximum parsimony ( Chewapreecha et al . , 2014a ) . For each node involving loss or gain of the capsule , those with at least one child being a tip were selected to find recent switches ( all were capsule gain ) . The carriage duration of all unencapsulated children of the identified node were used as the null distribution to calculate an empirical p-value for the switched isolate . P-values were combined using Fisher's method ( Rosenthal , 1978 ) . We used the linear mixed model implemented in fast-lmm ( RRID:SCR_015506 ) ( Lippert et al . , 2011 ) to associate genetic elements with carriage duration , independent of overall lineage effects . We used the warped phenotype as the response , the kinship matrix ( calculated from SNPs ) as random effects , and variant presence , child age and previous carriage as fixed effects . For SNPs we used a Bonferroni correction with \u03b1<0 . 05 and an N of 92487 phylogenetically independent sites to derive a genome-wide significance cutoff of p<5 . 4\u00d710-7 , and a suggestive significance cutoff ( Lander and Kruglyak , 1995; Stranger et al . , 2011 ) of p=1 . 1\u00d710-4 . We tested pairwise LD between the significant SNPs by calculating the R2 between them . We removed those with R2\u00a0>\u00a00 . 2 , assuming these represented the same underlying signal , to define the significant loci . To perform conditional analysis we used the pattern of the most significant SNP as a fixed-effect , removed it from the test and kinship estimation , and re-ran the mixed model on all other sites . For k-mers we counted 5254876 phylogenetically independent sites , giving a genome wide significance cutoff of 9 . 5\u00d710-9 . We used blastn ( RRID:SCR_001598 ) with default settings to map the significant k-mers to seven reference genomes ( ATCC 700669 , INV104B , OXC141 , SPNA45 , Taiwan19F , TIGR4 and NT_110_58 ) , and the possible Tn916 sequences ( Croucher et al . , 2011 ) . To search for variants with some level of lineage independence we used SEER ( RRID:SCR_015499 ) ( Lees et al . , 2016 ) . To correct for population structure we used the patristic distances from the phylogenetic tree as the kinship matrix , which we then projected into 30 dimensions using metric multidimensional scaling . The coordinates of the samples in this space were used as covariates in SEER\u2019s linear regression . We performed association tests on SNPs and k-mers with MAF > 1% using multiple linear regression , and report the top hits with p<10-14 . Significant k-mers were mapped as above . All code used for analysis is available on github , along with inferred carriage duration for each sample ( Lees , 2017 ) .

{"lay_summary":"Plants rely on carbon for their growth and survival: in a process called photosynthesis , they use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen gas . The chemical reactions that make up photosynthesis are powered by a chain of enzymes , and plants must ensure that these enzymes\u2014which are in the leaves of the plant\u2014are supplied with enough carbon dioxide and water . Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters plants through pores in their leaves , but water must be carried up the plant from the roots . The type of photosynthesis used by about 90% of flowering plant species\u2014including tomatoes and rice\u2014is called C3 photosynthesis . The first step in this process begins with an enzyme called RuBisCO , which reacts with carbon dioxide and a substance called RuBP to form molecules that contain three carbon atoms ( hence the name C3 photosynthesis ) . In a hot climate , however , a plant can lose a lot of water through the pores in its leaves: closing these pores allows the plant to retain water , but this also reduces the supply of carbon dioxide . Under these circumstances this causes problems because RuBisCO uses oxygen to break down RuBP , instead of creating sugars , when carbon dioxide is not readily available . To prevent this process , which wastes a lot of energy and resources , some plants\u2014including maize , sugar cane and many other agricultural staples\u2014have evolved an alternative process called C4 photosynthesis . Although it is more complex than C3 photosynthesis , and required many changes to be made to the structure of leaves , C4 photosynthesis has evolved on more than 60 different occasions . In C4 plants , the mesophyll\u2014the region that is associated with the capture of carbon dioxide by RuBisCO in C3 plants\u2014contains high levels of an alternative enzyme called PEPC that converts carbon dioxide molecules into an acid that contains four carbon atoms . To avoid carbon dioxide being captured by both enzymes , C4 plants evolved to relocate RuBisCO from the mesophyll to a second set of cells in an airtight structure known as the bundle sheath . The four-carbon acids produced by PEPC diffuse to the cells in the bundle sheath , where they are broken down into carbon dioxide molecules , and photosynthesis then proceeds as normal . This process allows photosynthesis to continue when the level of carbon dioxide in the leave is low because the plant has closed its pores to retain water . Since C4 plants grow faster than C3 plants , and also require less water , plant biologists would like to introduce certain C4 traits into C3 crop plants . To help with this process , Williams , Johnston et al . have used computational methods to explore how C4 photosynthesis evolved from ancestral C3 plants . This involved investigating the prevalence of 16 traits that are common to C4 plants in a total of 73 species that undergo C3 or C4 photosynthesis ( including 37 species that possess characteristics of both C3 and C4 ) . Williams , Johnston et al . then went on to produce a new mathematical model that represents evolutionary processes as pathways across a multi-dimensional \u201clandscape\u201d . The model shows that traits can be acquired in various orders , and that C4 photosynthesis evolved through a number of independent pathways . Some traits that evolved early in the transitions to C4 photosynthesis influenced how evolution proceeded , providing \u201cfoundations\u201d upon which further changes evolved . Interestingly , the structure of the leaf itself appeared to change before any of the photosynthetic enzymes changed . This led Williams , Johnston et al . to conclude that climate change\u2014in particular , the declines in carbon dioxide levels that occurred in prehistoric times\u2014was probably not responsible for the original evolution of C4 photosynthesis . Nevertheless , these results could help with efforts to adapt important C3 crop plants to on-going changes in our climate .","article":"C4 photosynthesis has independently evolved from the ancestral C3 pathway in at least 60 plant lineages , but , as with other complex traits , how it evolved is unclear . Here we show that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories . We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3 , C4 , or intermediate C3\u2013C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape . We then developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model that predicts how the C4 phenotype evolved . The alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral lineage and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis . We conclude that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers . This flexibility will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait . \n The convergent evolution of complex traits is surprisingly common , with examples including camera-like eyes of cephalopods , vertebrates , and cnidaria ( Kozmik et al . , 2008 ) , mimicry in invertebrates and vertebrates ( Santos et al . , 2003; Wilson et al . , 2012 ) and the different photosynthetic machineries of plants ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) . While the polyphyletic origin of simple traits ( Hill et al . , 2006; Steiner et al . , 2009 ) is underpinned by flexibility in the underlying molecular mechanisms , the extent to which this applies to complex traits is less clear . C4 photosynthesis is both highly complex , involving alterations to leaf anatomy , cellular ultrastructure , and photosynthetic metabolism , and also convergent , being found in at least 60 independent lineages of angiosperms ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) . As the emergence of the entire C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally , C4 photosynthesis is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution as transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape . Furthermore , understanding the evolutionary events that have generated C4 photosynthesis on many independent occasions has the potential to inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species ( Hibberd et al . , 2008 ) . The C4 pathway is estimated to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago ( Christin et al . , 2011b ) in response to multiple ecological drivers , including decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration ( Vicentini et al . , 2008 ) . C4 species have since radiated to represent the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet because modifications to their leaves increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in the sub-tropics and tropics ( Edwards et al . , 2010 ) . In C4 plants , photosynthetic efficiency is improved compared with C3 species because significant alterations to leaf anatomy , cell biology and biochemistry lead to higher concentrations of CO2 around the primary carboxylase RuBisCO Slack and Hatch , 1967; Langdale , 2011 ) . The morphology of C4 leaves is typically modified into so-called Kranz anatomy that consists of repeating units of vein , bundle sheath ( BS ) and mesophyll ( M ) cells ( Hattersley , 1984; Langdale , 2011 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Photosynthetic metabolism becomes modified and compartmentalised between the M and BS , with M cells lacking RuBisCO but instead containing high activities of the alternate carboxylase PEPC to generate C4 acids . The diffusion of these acids followed by their decarboxylation in BS cells around RuBisCO increases CO2 supply and therefore photosynthetic efficiency ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . C4 acids are decarboxylated by at least one of three enzymes within BS cells: NADP- or NAD-dependent malic enzymes ( NADP-ME or NAD-ME respectively ) , or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PCK ) ( Hatch et al . , 1975 ) . Specific lineages of C4 species have typically been classified into one of three sub-types , based on the activity of these decarboxylases , as well as anatomical and cellular traits that consistently correlate with each other ( Furbank , 2011 ) . The genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of cell-specific gene expression associated with the separation of photosynthetic metabolism between M and BS cells involve both alterations to cis-elements and trans-acting factors ( Akyildiz et al . , 2007; Brown et al . , 2011; Kajala et al . , 2012; Williams et al . , 2012 ) . Phylogenetically independent lineages of C4 plants have co-opted homologous mechanisms to generate cell specificity ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) as well as the altered allosteric regulation of C4 enzymes ( Christin et al . , 2007 ) indicating that parallel evolution underpins at least part of the convergent C4 syndrome . However , while a substantial amount of work has addressed the molecular alterations that generate the biochemical differences between C3 and C4 plants ( Williams et al . , 2012 ) much less is known about the order and flexibility with which phenotypic traits important for C4 photosynthesis are acquired ( Sage et al . , 2012 ) . Clues to this question exist in the form of C3\u2013C4 intermediates , species exhibiting characteristics of both C3 or C4 photosynthesis , such as the activity or localisation of C4 cycle enzymes ( Hattersley and Stone , 1986 ) , the possession of one or more anatomical or cellular adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis ( Moore et al . , 1987 ) , or combinations of both ( e . g . , Kennedy et al . , 1980; Kotayeva et al . , 2010 ) . To address these unknown aspects of C4 evolutionary history , we combined the concept of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes ( Wright , 1932; Gavrilets , 1997 ) with the analysis of extant C3\u2013C4 intermediate species to develop a predictive model of how the full C4 phenotype evolved . \n To parameterise the phenotypic landscape underlying photosynthetic phenotypes , data was consolidated from 43 studies encompassing 18 C3 , 18 C4 , and 37 C3\u2013C4 intermediate species from 22 genera ( Table 1 ) . These C3\u2013C4 species are from 18 independent lineages likely representing 18 distinct evolutionary origins of C3\u2013C4 intermediacy ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These studies were used to quantify 16 biochemical , anatomical , and cellular characteristics associated with C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Principal components analysis ( PCA ) was performed to confirm the phenotypic intermediacy of the C3\u2013C4 species ( Figure 1A ) . This result , the sister-group relationships of C3\u2013C4 species with congeneric C4 clades ( McKown et al . , 2005; Vogan et al . , 2007; Christin et al . , 2011a; Sage et al . , 2011a; Khoshravesh et al . , 2012 ) and the prevalence of extant C3\u2013C4 species in genera with the most recent origins of C4 photosynthesis ( Christin et al . , 2011b ) all support the notion that C3\u2013C4 species represent phenotypic states through which transitions to C4 photosynthesis could occur . The combined traits of C3\u2013C4 intermediate species therefore represent samples from across the space of phenotypes connecting C3 to C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 1B ) . Within our meta-analysis data , C3\u2013C4 phenotypes were available for 33 eudicot and 4 monocot species . 16 and 17 of these species have extant congeneric relatives performing NADP-ME or NAD-ME sub-type C4 photosynthesis respectively . No C3\u2013C4 relatives of PCK sub-type C4 species are known ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) . Our meta-analysis therefore encompassed a variety of taxonomic lineages , as well as representing close relatives of known phenotypic variants performing C4 photosynthesis . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 003Table 1 .

A graphical representation of key phenotypic changes distinguishing C3 and C4 leaves . Plants using C4 photosynthesis possess a number of anatomical , cellular , and biochemical adaptations that distinguish them from C3 ancestors . These include decreased vein spacing ( A ) and enlarged bundle sheath ( BS ) cells , which lie adjacent to veins ( B ) . Together , these adaptations decrease the ratio of mesophyll ( M ) to BS cell volume . C4 metabolism is generated by the increased abundance and M or BS-specific expression of multiple enzymes ( shown in purple ) , which are expressed in both M and BS cells of C3 leaves .

Illustration of the principle by which evolutionary pathways emit intermediate signals . In this illustration , the phenotype consists of three traits , yielding a simple ( hyper ) cubic transition network . Simulated trajectories on this network evolve according to the weights of network edges ( A ) . Probabilities were calculated from the signals emitted by simulated trajectories at intermediate nodes ( B ) . Ensembles of trajectories were simulated to obtain probabilities from these signals for every possible evolutionary transition ( C ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 009 We defined each C4 trait as either being absent ( 0 ) or present ( 1 ) . For quantitative traits the expectation-maximization ( EM ) algorithm and hierarchical clustering were used to impartially assign binary scores ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . This generated a 16-bit string for each of the species ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) , with a presence or absence score for each of the traits included in our meta-analysis . This defined a 16-dimensional phenotype space with 216 ( 65 , 536 ) nodes corresponding to all possible combinations of presence ( 1 ) and absence ( 0 ) scores for each characteristic . Many existing methods of inference for evolutionary trajectories rely on phylogenetic information or assumptions about the fitness landscape underlying evolutionary dynamics ( Weinreich et al . , 2005; Lobkovsky et al . , 2011; Mooers and Heard , 2013 ) . In convergent evolution , these properties are not always known , as convergent lineages may be genetically distant and associated with poor phylogenetic reconstructions . In addition , the selective pressures experienced by each may be different and dynamic . We therefore consider the convergent evolution of C4 fundamentally as the acquisition of the key phenotypic traits identified through our meta-analysis ( Figure 1B ) . The process of acquisition of these traits can be pictured as a path on the 16-dimensional hypercube ( Figure 1C ) , from the node labelled with all 0\u2019s ( the C3 phenotype , with no C4 characteristics ) to the node labelled with all 1\u2019s ( the C4 phenotype , with all C4 characteristics ) . The phenotypic landscape underlying the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was then modelled as a transition network , with weighted edges describing the probability of transitions occurring between two phenotypic states ( two nodes on the hypercube , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Observed intermediate points were then used to constrain the structure of these phenotypic landscapes . To do this , we developed inferential machinery based on the framework of Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) ( Rabiner , 1989 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) and simulated an ensemble of Markov chains on trial transition networks . Each of these chains represents a possible evolutionary pathway from C3 to C4 , and passes through several intermediate phenotypic states . The likelihood of observing intermediate states with characteristics compatible with the biologically observed data on C3\u2013C4 intermediates was recorded for the set of paths supported on each trial network . A Bayesian MCMC procedure was used to sample from the set of networks most compatible with the meta-analysis dataset , and thus most likely to represent the underlying dynamics of C4 evolution . The order in which phenotypic characteristics were acquired was recorded for paths on each network compatible with the C3\u2013C4 species data , and posterior probability distributions ( given uninformative priors ) for the time-ordered acquisition of each C4 trait were generated . For further information and mathematical details , see \u2018Methods\u2019 . To model the evolutionary paths generating C4 without requiring additional dimensionality , we imposed that only one C4 trait may be acquired at a time , and loss of acquired C4 traits was forbidden . To test if we were nevertheless able to detect traits acquired simultaneously in evolution , we tested our approach on artificial positive control datasets containing intermediate nodes representing a stepwise evolutionary sequence of events ( Figure 2A ) and an evolutionary pathway in which four traits are acquired simultaneously at a time ( Figure 2B ) . Our approach clearly assigned equal acquisition probabilities to traits whose timing was linked in the underlying dataset , even when 50% of the data was occluded ( Figure 2B ) . These data are consistent with this approach detecting the simultaneous acquisition of traits in evolution , even though single-trait acquisitions are simulated . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 010Figure 2 . Verifying a novel Bayesian approach for predicting evolutionary trajectories . ( A and B ) Datasets were obtained from an artificially constructed diagonal dynamic matrix ( A ) , and a diagonal matrix with linked timing of locus acquisitions ( B ) . The single , diagonal evolutionary trajectory was clearly replicated in both examples , over a time-scale of 16 individual steps , or four coarse-grained quartiles . We subjected these artificial datasets to our inferential machinery with fully characterised artificial species , and with 50% of data occluded in order to replicate the proportion of missing data from our C3\u2013C4 dataset . ( C ) When applied to our meta-analysis of C3\u2013C4 data , predictions were generated for every trait missing from the biological dataset . We tested this predictive machinery by generating 29 artificial datasets , each missing one data point , and comparing the presence\/absence of the trait as predicted by our approach with the experimental data from the original study . ( D and E ) Quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) was used to verify the predicted phenotypes of four C3\u2013C4 species . The abundance RbcS ( D ) and MDH ( E ) transcripts were determined from six Flaveria species .

A probability for the presence of unobserved phenotypic characters was generated for every characteristic not yet studied in each of the C3\u2013C4 species included in this study . Red ( upward triangles ) predict a posterior mean probability of >0 . 75 for the presence of a C4 trait; blue ( downward triangles ) predict a posterior mean probability of <0 . 25 . Darker triangles represent probabilities whose standard deviations ( SD ) are lower than 0 . 25 . Yellow blocks correspond to known data: no symbol is present for traits for which presence and absence have an equal probability ( 0 . 25\u20130 . 75 ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 011 The presence and absence of unknown phenotypes were predicted by recording all phenotypes encountered along a set of simulated evolutionary trajectories that were compatible with the data from a given species ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , and calculating the posterior distribution of the proportion of these phenotypes with the value 1 for the unknown trait . If the mean of this distribution was <25% or >75% , and that value fell outside one standard deviation of the mean , the missing trait was assigned a strong prediction of absence or presence . To comprehensively test the accuracy of our predictive machinery , we generated 29 occluded datasets , consisting of the original full dataset with one randomly chosen data point removed . The predicted phenotype of each missing trait was then compared with the known phenotype published in the original study . For 29 occluded traits 18 were strongly predicted to be present or absent , and the remaining 11 predictions were neutral . Of the 18 strongly predicted traits ( i . e . , <25% or >75% probability ) , 15 were correct , with only one false positive and two false negative predictions ( Figure 2C ) . The approach therefore assigns neutral predictions much more frequently than false positive or false negative predictions , suggesting that its outputs are highly conservative , and thus unlikely to produce artefacts . Predictions were generated for phenotypes that have not yet been described in C3\u2013C4 species ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Quantitative real-time PCR experimentally verified a subset of these , relating to abundance of C4 enzymes not previously measured ( Figure 2D\u2013E ) . We also found that the model was able to successfully infer evolutionary dynamics in artificially constructed datasets ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . Taken together , these prediction and verification studies illustrate that our approach robustly identifies key features of C4 evolution . The posterior probability distributions for the acquisition time of each phenotypic trait were combined to produce an objective , computationally generated blueprint for the order of evolutionary events generating C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 3 ) . These results were consistent with previous work on subsets of C4 lineages that proposed the BS-specificity of GDC occurs prior to the evolution of C4 metabolism ( Hylton et al . , 1988; Rawsthorne et al . , 1988; Devi et al . , 1995; Sage et al . , 2012 ) , and loss of RuBisCO from M cells occurs late ( Cheng et al . , 1988; Khoshravesh et al . , 2012 ) , but also provided higher resolution insight into the order of events generating C4 metabolism . Alterations to leaf anatomy as well as cell-specificity and increased abundance of multiple C4 cycle enzymes were predicted to evolve prior to any alteration to the primary C3 and C4 photosynthetic enzymes RuBisCO and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase ( PEPC ) ( Figure 3 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 012Figure 3 .

Traits were also assigned presence\/absence scores by hierarchical clustering . Analysis of data partitioned by hierarchical clustering predicted a similar sequence of evolutionary events to that shown in Figure 3 ( A ) . Direct comparison of posterior probabilities reveals a high degree of similarity between results from the data clustered by hierarchical clustering versus the EM algorithm ( B ) . These results suggest our conclusions are not affected by the different methods of assigning binary scores to traits .

Adding or removing traits does not affect the predicted order of evolutionary events . Two independent pairs of traits were randomly selected and deleted from the analysis . In both cases , removing two traits did not affect the predicted timing of the remaining 14 traits in the analysis ( A and B ) . Furthermore , including two additional traits associated with C4 photosynthesis also did not alter the predicted timing of other traits ( C ) . Together , these data suggest our results are robust to both the removal and addition of traits from the phenotype space .

The extent to which C4 traits are linked in evolution was assessed by modelling C4 evolution from a start phenotype with one trait already acquired . Linked traits would have a high probability of being acquired in the next event . Artificially acquired traits are listed on the x-axis and the probability of each additional C4 trait being subsequently acquired ( y-axis ) is denoted in each pixel of the heat map . There is overall very low probability for multiple traits being linked in their acquisition in the evolution of C4 . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 015 There was also strong evidence for enlargement of BS cells as an early innovation in most C4 lineages ( Figure 3 ) , consistent with the suggestion that this was an ancestral state within C3 ancestors of C4 grass lineages and that this contributed to the high number of C4 origins within this family ( Christin et al . , 2013; Griffiths et al . , 2013 ) . The compartmentation of PEPC into M cells and its increased abundance compared with C3 leaves was predicted to occur at similar times , but for all other C4 enzymes the evolution of increased abundance and cellular compartmentation were clearly separated by the acquisition of other traits ( Figure 3 ) . This result is consistent with molecular analysis of genes encoding C4 enzymes that indicates cell-specificity and increased expression are mediated by different cis-elements ( Akyildiz et al . , 2007; Kajala et al . , 2012; Wiludda et al . , 2012 ) . Two approaches were taken to verify that these conclusions are robust and accurately reflect biological data . First , the analysis was repeated using scores for presence or absence of traits that were assigned by hierarchical clustering , as opposed to using the EM algorithm ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Although hierarchical clustering generated differences in the scoring of a small number of traits , the predicted evolutionary trajectories were not affected , producing highly similar results ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Second , we introduced structural changes to the phenotype space , by both adding and subtracting traits from the analysis ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Removing two independent pairs of traits from the analysis did not affect the predicted timing of the remaining 14 traits ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B ) . However , increased standard deviations were observed in some cases ( e . g . , for the probabilities of acquiring enlarged BS cells , or decreased vein spacing ) likely a consequence of using fewer data . To test if the addition of data might also affect the results , we performed an analysis with two additional traits included ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . We selected two traits that have been widely observed in C3\u2013C4 species , the centripetal positioning of mitochondria and the centrifugal or centripetal position of chloroplasts within BS cells ( Sage et al . , 2012 ) . Despite the widespread occurrence of these traits , their functional importance remains unclear ( Sage et al . , 2012 ) . Consistent with observations made from several genera , we predict that these cellular alterations are acquired early in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis ( Hylton et al . , 1988; McKown and Dengler , 2007; Muhaidat et al . , 2011; Sage et al . , 2011b ) . Importantly , including these additional early traits in the analysis did not alter the predicted order of the original 16 traits . Together , these analyses did not alter our main conclusions , suggesting that they are robust . In addition to the likely order of evolutionary events generating C4 photosynthesis , the number of molecular alterations required is also unknown . We therefore aimed to test if multiple traits were predicted to evolve with linked timing , and therefore likely mediated by a single underlying mechanism . To achieve this , we performed a contingency analysis by considering trajectories across phenotype space beginning with a given initial acquisition step . In this analysis , the starting genome had one of the 16 traits acquired and the rest absent , and the contingency of the subsequent trajectory upon the initial step was recorded . This approach was designed to test if acquiring one C4 trait increased the probability of subsequently acquiring other traits , thus detecting if the evolution of multiple traits is linked by underlying mechanisms . Inflexible linkage between multiple traits was detected in artificial positive control datasets ( Figure 2B ) but not in the C3\u2013C4 dataset ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . This result suggests that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible . Multiple origins of C4 may therefore have been facilitated by this flexibility in the evolutionary pathways connecting C3 and C4 phenotypes . Our Bayesian analysis strongly indicates that there are multiple evolutionary pathways by which C4 traits are acquired by all lineages of C4 plants . First , no single sequence of acquisitions was capable of producing intermediate phenotypes compatible with all observations ( \u2018Methods\u2019 ) . Second , several traits such as compartmentation of GDC into BS and the increased number of chloroplasts in the BS clearly displayed bimodal probability distributions for their acquisition ( Figure 3 ) . This bimodality is indicative of multiple distinct pathways to C4 photosynthesis that acquire traits at earlier or later times . To investigate factors underlying this bimodality , we inferred evolutionary pathways generating the C4 leaf using data from monocot and eudicot lineages , or from lineages using NAD malic enzyme ( NAD\u2013ME ) or NADP malic enzyme ( NADP-ME ) as their primary C4 acid decarboxylase . PCA on the entire set of inferred transition networks for monocot and dicot subsets revealed distinct separation ( Figure 4A ) , suggesting that the topology of the evolutionary landscape surrounding C4 is largely different for these two anciently diverged taxa . Performing this PCA including networks that were inferred from the full data set ( with both lineages ) confirmed that this separation is a robust result and involves posterior variation on a comparable scale to that of the full set of possible networks ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Analysis of the posterior probabilities of the mean pathways representing either monocots or dicots revealed that this separation is the result of differences in the timing of events generating both anatomical and biochemical traits ( Figure 4C ) . We propose that the ancient divergence of the monocot and eudicot clades constrained the evolution of C4 photosynthesis to broadly different evolutionary pathways in each . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 016Figure 4 . Differences in the evolutionary events generating different C4 sub-types and distantly related taxa . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) on the entire landscape of transition probabilities using only monocot and eudicot data ( A ) and data from NADP-ME and NAD-ME sub-type lineages ( B ) shows broad differences between the evolutionary pathways generating C4 in each taxon . Monocots and eudicots differ in the predicted timing of events generating C4 anatomy and biochemistry ( C ) , whereas NADP-ME and NAD-ME lineages differ primarily in the evolution of decreased vein spacing and greater numbers of chloroplasts in BS cells ( D ) .

PCA was performed on sampled transition networks from the sets compatible with the overall dataset and each of the two subsets corresponding to different lineages: overall\/monocot\/eudicot ( A ) overall\/NAD-ME\/NADP-ME ( B ) . In ( A ) the variation between monocot and eudicot lineages is observed to be preserved when the overall transition networks are included , and on a similar quantitative scale to the variation in the overall set , embedded mainly on the first principal axis . In ( B ) the variation is of a similar scale but less distinct , correlating more with the second principal axis . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 00961 . 017 There was more overlap between the landscapes generating NAD\u2013ME and NADP-ME species ( Figure 4B ) , likely reflecting the convergent origins of NAD\u2013ME and NADP-ME sub-types ( Furbank , 2011; Sage et al . , 2011a ) . Despite the traditional definition of these lineages on the basis of biochemical differences , we detected differences in the timing of their anatomical evolution ( Figure 4D ) . For example , in NAD\u2013ME lineages , increased vein density was predicted to be acquired early in C4 evolution , while in NADP-ME species this trait showed a broadly different trajectory ( Figure 4D ) . The proliferation of chloroplasts in the BS was also acquired with different timings between the two sub-types . The alternative evolutionary pathways generating the NADP-ME and NAD\u2013ME subtypes were therefore defined by differences in the timing of anatomical and cellular traits that are predicted to precede the majority of biochemical alterations ( Figure 3 , Figure 4D ) . We therefore conclude that these distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures . Furthermore , we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space . \n The adaptive landscape metaphor has provided a powerful conceptual framework within which evolutionary transitions can be modelled ( Gavrilets , 1997; Whibley et al . , 2006; Lobkovsky et al . , 2011 ) . However , the majority of complex biological traits provide numerous challenges in utilising such an approach , including missing phenotypic data , incomplete phylogenetic information and in the case of convergent evolution , variable ancestral states . Here we report the development of a novel , predictive Bayesian approach that is able to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled , highly stochastic data . With this model , we provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages: C4 photosynthesis . However , as our approach is not dependent on detailed phylogenetic inference , we propose that it could be used to model the evolution of other complex traits , such as those in the fossil record , which are also currently limited by the fragmented nature of data available ( Kidwell and Holland , 2002 ) . Our approach is also not limited by the time-scale over which predicted trajectories occur . As a result , it may be useful in inferring pathways underlying stochastic processes occurring over much shorter timescales , such as disease or tumour progression , or the differentiation of cell types . A central hypothesis for the ecological drivers of C4 evolution is that declining CO2 concentration in the Oligocene decreased the rate of carboxylation by RuBisCO , creating a strong pressure to evolve alternative photosynthetic strategies ( Christin et al . , 2008; Vicentini et al . , 2008 ) . According to this hypothesis , alterations to the localisation and abundance of the primary carboxylases PEPC and RuBisCO would be expected to occur early in the evolutionary trajectories generating C4 . Conversely , our data suggest that alterations to anatomy and cell biology were predicted to precede the majority of biochemical alterations , and that other enzymes of the C4 pathway are recruited prior to PEPC and RuBisCO ( Figure 3 ) . These enzymes , such as PPDK and C4 acid decarboxylases , function in processes not related to photosynthesis within leaves of C3 plants ( Aubry et al . , 2011 ) , so the early changes to abundance and localisation of these enzymes within C4 lineages may have been driven by non-photosynthetic pressures . A recent in silico study also predicts that changes to photorespiratory metabolism and GDC in BS cells evolved prior to the C4 pathway ( Heckman et al . , 2013 ) . Our model predicts that BS-specificity of GDC was acquired early in C4 evolution for the majority of lineages . However , we also note that the predicted timing of GDC BS-specificity is bimodal in our analysis ( Figure 3 ) , and not predicted to be acquired early in monocot lineages ( Figure 4C ) . These results suggest that this is not a feature of C4 evolution to have occurred repeatedly in all lineages . Recent evidence from physiological and ecological studies has identified a number of additional environmental pressures that may have driven the evolution and radiation of C4 lineages , including high evaporative demands ( Osborne and Sack , 2012 ) and increased fire frequency ( Edwards et al . , 2010 ) . Increased BS volume and vein density have been proposed as likely adaptations to improve leaf hydraulics under drought ( Osborne and Sack , 2012; Griffiths et al . 2013 ) , but nothing is known about how early recruitment of GDC , PPDK , and C4 acid decarboxylases ( Figure 3 ) may relate to these pressures . A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of these enzymes ( Brown et al . , 2011; Kajala et al . , 2012; Wiludda et al . , 2012 ) may help identify the key molecular events facilitating C4 evolution . Our data also suggest that modifications to leaf development drove the evolution of diverse C4 sub-types . For example , we find that differences in the timing of events altering leaf vascular development and BS chloroplast division occur prior to the appearance of the alternative evolutionary pathways generating the NADP-ME and NAD-ME biochemical sub-types ( Figure 4D ) . These traits are predicted to evolve prior to any alterations to the C4 acid decarboxylase enzymes that traditionally define these sub-types ( Furbank , 2011 ) . As an homologous mechanism has been shown to regulate the cell-specificity of gene expression in both NADP-ME and NAD-ME gene families in independent lineages ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) , it is unlikely that mechanisms underlying the recruitment of these enzymes drove the evolution of distinct sub-types . We therefore conclude that these different sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in leaf development , rather than biochemical or photosynthetic pressures . This may explain why differences in the carboxylation efficiency or photosynthetic performance of different C4 sub-types have never been detected ( Furbank , 2011 ) , making the adaptive significance of different decarboxylation mechanisms difficult to explain . Instead , we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space . The numerous differences in leaf development and cell biology between C4 sub-types ( Furbank , 2011 ) may provide clues as to which developmental changes underlie subsequent differences in metabolic evolution . C4 photosynthesis provides an excellent example of how independent lineages with a wide range of ancestral phenotypes can converge upon similar complex traits . Several studies on more simple traits have demonstrated that convergence upon a phenotype can be specified by diverse genotypes , and thus non-homologous molecular mechanisms in independent lineages ( Wittkopp et al . , 2003; Hill et al . , 2006; Steiner et al . , 2009 ) . Taken together , our data also indicate that flexibility in the viable series of evolutionary events has also facilitated the convergence of this highly complex trait . First , we show that at least four distinct evolutionary trajectories underlie the evolution of C4 lineages ( Figure 4 ) . Second , we find no evidence for inflexible linkage between the predicted timing of distinct C4 traits ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This diversity in viable pathways also helps explain why C4 has been accessible to such a wide variety of species and not limited to a smaller subset of the angiosperm phylogeny . A recent model for the evolution of the biochemistry associated with the C4 leaf also found that C4 photosynthesis was accessible from any surrounding point of a fitness landscape ( Heckman et al . , 2013 ) . Our study of C4 anatomy , biochemistry , and cell biology also suggests the C4 phenotype is accessible from multiple trajectories . Encouragingly , the trajectories predicted by Heckman et al . ( 2013 ) were found to pass through phenotypes of C3\u2013C4 species , despite the fact that these species were not used to parameterise the evolutionary landscape . As different mechanisms generate increased abundance and cell-specificity for the majority C4 enzymes in independent C4 lineages ( reviewed in Langdale , 2011; Williams et al . , 2012 ) , it is likely that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis and may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits . This may benefit efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through the genetic engineering of C3 species ( Hibberd et al . , 2008 ) , expanding the molecular toolbox available to establish C4 traits in distinct phenotypic backgrounds . \n Data from eighteen C3 , seventeen C4 , and thirty-seven C3\u2013C4 species were consolidated from 43 studies that have examined the phenotypic characteristics of C3\u2013C4 species since their discovery in 1974 ( Table 1 ) . Values for sixteen of the most widely studied C3 characteristics were recorded for each intermediate species , as well as congeneric C3 and C4 relatives where available . The majority of data on enzyme abundance and the number and size of bundle sheath ( BS ) chloroplasts were obtained from studies employing the same methodology and were thus cross-comparable ( e . g . , Goldstein et al . , 1976; Ku et al . , 1976; Ku and Edwards , 1978; Sayre et al . , 1979; Holaday et al . , 1981; Holaday and Black , 1981; Ku et al . , 1983; Adams et al . , 1986; Rajendrudu et al . , 1986; Ku et al . , 1991; Devi and Raghavendra , 1993; Bruhl and Perry , 1995; Casati et al . , 1999; Keeley , 1999 ) . These cross-comparable quantitative data were partitioned into presence absence scores using two clustering techniques , the expectation-maximisation ( EM ) algorithm and hierarchical clustering ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . EM clustering was performed using a one-dimensional mixture model with two assigned components ( e . g . , presence and absence clusters ) , allowing for variable variance between the two components of the model , and variable population size between the two components . Hierarchical clustering was performed using a complete-linkage agglomerative approach , partitioning clusters by maximum distance according to a Euclidean distance metric . This approach identifies clusters with common variance , thus contrasting with the clusters of variable variance identifiable by EM . For quantitative data not comparable with other studies ( e . g . , Ku and Edwards , 1978; Rathnam and Chollet , 1978; Rathnam and Chollet , 1979; Holaday et al . , 1984; Brown and Hattersley , 1989; Beebe and Evert , 1990; P\u2019yankov et al . , 1997; Gowik et al . , 2011 ) , values obtained for intermediate species were scored as 1 or 0 if they were closer to the values for the respective C4 or C3 controls used in the original study . For qualitative abundance data from immunoblots ( e . g . , Rosche et al . , 1994; Voznesenskaya et al . , 2007; Voznesenskaya , 2010 ) , relative band intensity was measured using ImageJ software ( Abramoff et al . , 2004 ) and abundance was scored as 1 or 0 if the band intensity value was closer to the C4 or C3 control respectively . For qualitative cell-specificity data from immunolocalisations ( e . g . Voznesenskaya et al . , 2001; Ueno et al . , 2003 , 2006; Muhaidat et al . , 2011 ) , a presence score was only assigned if the enzyme appeared completely absent from either mesophyll ( M ) or BS cells . We represent the phenotypic properties of each intermediate species as a string of L = 16 numbers ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . We will refer to these strings as phenotype strings of L loci , with each locus describing data on the corresponding phenotypic trait . In a given locus , 0 denotes the absence of a C4 trait , 1 denotes the presence of a C4 trait , and 2 denotes missing data . PCA was performed on five variables for C4 cycle enzyme activity , with missing values estimated using the EM algorithm for PCA as described by Roweis ( 1998 ) . The fundamental element underlying our analysis is a transition network P , consisting of a directed graph with 2L = 65 , 536 nodes , and the weight of the edge Pij denoting the probability of a transition occurring from node i to node j . Each node corresponds to a possible phenotype: we labeled nodes with labels li so that li was the binary representation of the phenotype at node i , and Pij takes on the specific meaning of the probability of a transition from phenotype li to phenotype lj . We made several restrictions on the structure of P . We allowed only transitions that change a given phenotype at one locus , so Pij = 0 if H ( li , lj ) \u2260 1 , where H ( b1 , b2 ) is the Hamming distance between bitstrings b1 and b2 . Transitions that changed loci with value 1 to value 0 ( steps back towards the C3 state ) were forbidden , so Pij = 0 if H ( li , l0 ) > H ( lj , l0 ) , where l0 is the phenotypic string containing only zeroes . We assume that the possibility of events involving backwards steps , and multiple simultaneous trait acquisitions constitute second-order effects which will not strongly influence the inferred evolutionary dynamics . Given the transition network P , we modelled the evolutionary trajectories that may give rise to C4 photosynthesis through the picture of a discrete analogue to a Brownian bridge , that is as a stochastic process on P with constrained start and end positions ( Revuz and Yor , 1999 ) . We enforced the start state of the process to be lC3\u2261l0=0\u20260 ( the phenotype string of all zeroes ) and the end state , through the imposed structure of P , to be lC4\u2261l2L\u22121=1\u20261 ( the string of all ones ) . The dynamics of the process between these points consisted of L steps , with a phenotypic trait being acquired at each step , and a step from node i to node j occurring with probability Pij . As many evolutionary trajectories may lead to the acquisition of the required phenotypic traits , we considered an ensemble of evolutionary trajectories for each transition network . Each member of this ensemble is started at lC3 and allowed to step across the network according to probabilities P . To compare the dynamics of a given transition network to the properties of observed biological intermediates , we pictured this ensemble of trajectories as a modification of a hidden Markov model ( HMM [Rabiner , 1989] ) . At each timestep in each individual trajectory , the process may with some probability emit a signal to the observer , with that signal being simply li , the label of the node at which the process currently resides . Over an ensemble of trajectories , a set of randomly emitted signals is thus built up ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . We define a compatibility function between two strings as ( 1 ) C ( s , t ) =\u220fi=1Lc ( si , ti ) ( 2 ) c ( si , ti ) ={1if\u00a0si=ti\u00a0or\u00a0si=2\u00a0or\u00a0ti=2;0otherwise . C ( s , t ) thus returns 1 if a signal comprising string s could be responsible for observation t once some of the loci within s have been obscured: signal s is compatible with observation t . We wish to compute the likelihood of observing biological data B given a transition network P . Under our model , this likelihood is calculated by considering the compatibility of randomly emitted signals from processes supported by P with the observed data B . We write ( 3 ) L ( P|B ) =\u220fi\u2211chains\u00a0x\u2211signals\u00a0s\u2119chain ( x|P ) \u2119emission ( s|x ) C ( s , Bi ) Here , \u2119chain ( x|P ) is the probability of specific trajectory x arising on network P , \u2119emission ( s|x ) is the probability that trajectory x emits signal s , and C ( s , Bi ) gives the compatibility of signal s with intermediate state Bi . The term within the product operator thus describes the probability that evolutionary dynamics on network P give rise to a signal that is compatible with species Bi , with the overall likelihood being the product of this probability over all observed species . The uniform and random nature of signal emission means that \u2119emission ( s|x ) is a constant if signal s can be emitted from trajectory x , and zero otherwise . Our simulation approach only produces signals which can be emitted from the trajectory under consideration , so \u2119emission ( s|x ) will always take the same constant value ( which depends on the probability of signal emissions ) . As we will be considering ratios of network likelihoods and will not be concerned with absolute likelihoods we will ignore this term henceforth . For each network P we simulate an ensemble of Nchain trajectories and , for each node encountered throughout this ensemble , we record compatibilities with each of the biologically observed intermediates . We sum these compatibilities over the ensemble , obtaining \u2211chains\u00a0x\u2119chain ( x|P ) C ( s , Bi ) . A network that does not encounter any node compatible with a particular intermediate will thus be assigned zero likelihood; networks that encounter compatible nodes many times will be assigned high likelihoods . For each transition network , we simulated Nchain = 2 \u00d7 104 individual trajectories running from C3 to C4 . This value was chosen after preliminary investigations to analyse the ability of trajectory ensembles to broadly sample available paths on networks . Given uninformative prior knowledge about the evolutionary dynamics leading to C4 photosynthesis ( specifically , our prior involves each possible transition from a given node being assigned equal probability ) , we aimed to build a posterior distribution over a suitable description of the evolutionary dynamics . We represented the dynamics supported on a network P through a matrix \u03c0 , where \u03c0i , n describes the probability that acquisition of trait i occurs at the nth step in an evolutionary trajectory . The values of matrix \u03c0i , n were built up from sampling over the ensemble of trajectories simulated on P . We used Bayesian MCMC to sample networks based on their associated likelihood values ( Wasserman , 2004 ) . At each iteration , we perturbed the transition probability of the current network P a small amount ( see below ) to yield a new trial network P\u2019 . We calculated L ( P'|B ) and accepted P as the new network if L ( P'|B ) L ( P|B ) >r , where r was taken from U ( 0 , 1 ) . For practical reasons we implemented this scheme using log-likelihoods . The perturbations we applied to transition probabilities are Normally distributed in logarithmic space: for each edge wij we used w'ij=exp ( lnwij+N ( 0 , \u03c32 ) ) . To show that this scheme obeys detailed balance , consider two states A and A' , for simplicity described by a one-dimensional scalar quantity . Consider the proposed move from A when \u0394 is the result of the random draw . This proposal is A\u2192A' if A'=exp ( lnA+\u0394 ) =Ae\u0394 , implying that A=A'e\u2212\u0394 . The probability of proposing move A\u2192A' is thus N ( x=\u0394|0 , \u03c32 ) , and the probability of proposing A\u2192A' is N ( x=\u2212\u0394|0 , \u03c32 ) . By the symmetry of the Normal distribution , these two probabilities are equal . We started each MCMC run with a randomly initialised transition matrix . We allowed 2 \u00d7 104 burn-in steps then sampled over a further 2 \u00d7 105 steps . The value \u03c3 = 0 . 1 was chosen for the perturbation kernel . These values were chosen through an initial investigation to analyse the convergence of MCMC runs under different parameterisations . We performed 40 MCMC runs for each experiment and confirmed that the resulting posterior distributions had converged and yielded consistent results . We report the posterior distributions \u2119 ( \u03c0i , n ) inferred from sampling compatible networks as above . In the coarse-grained time representation , we use \u03c0i , n'CG=\u2119 ( \u2211\u200bn=1+4 ( n'\u22121 ) 4n'\u03c0i , n ) , summing over sets of ordinals of size 4 . We used the transition network P , rather than a more coarse-grained representation of the evolutionary dynamics ( e . g . , the summary matrices \u03c0 ) , as the fundamental element within our simulations so as not to discard possible details that would be lost in a coarse-grained approach \u2013 for example , the presence of multiple distinct pathways , which may be averaged over in a summary matrix . To verify our approach , we constructed artificial data sets , consisting of sets of strings in which phenotypic traits were acquired in a single ordering . Specifically , \u03c0i , n = \u03b4i , n , so the first step always resulted in acquiring the first trait , and so on . To test the approach in a pleiotropic setting , where multiple traits were acquired simultaneously , we also constructed data sets where traits were acquired at only four timesteps , each corresponding to the simultaneous acquisition of four traits . We subjected these datasets to our inferential machinery with all data intact , and with 50% of data points occluded , to determine the sensitivity and robustness of our approach ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . The approach accurately determines the ordering of events in both the bare and occluded cases and assigns very similar posterior probability distributions to the ordering of those traits acquired simultaneously . To compare the pathways generating C4 in monocots and eudicots , and in NADP-ME and NAD-ME sub-type lineages , we performed inference on two data sets: B1 and B2 , each comprising phenotype measurements from one of the groups of interest . We reported the posteriors on the resulting summary dynamics \u2119 ( \u03c0i , n ) as before , and for the principal components analysis ( PCA ) we sampled 103 summary dynamic matrices \u03c0i , n from the inferred posterior distribution during the Bayesian MCMC procedure , and performed PCA on these sampled matrices . When a simulated chain encountered a phenotypic node compatible with a given biological intermediate , the values of traits corresponding to missing data in the biological data were recorded . These recorded values , sampled over the sampled set of networks , allowed us to place probabilities on the values of biologically unobserved traits inferred from the encounters of compatible dynamics with the corresponding phenotypic possibilities . For example , if 70% of paths on network P pass through point 101 and 30% pass through point 001 , we infer a 70% probability that the missing trait in biological intermediate 201 takes the value 1 . Predictions were presented if the inferred probability of a \u20181\u2019 value was >75% ( predicting a \u20181\u2019 ) or <25% ( predicting a \u20180\u2019 ) . If one of these inequalities held and the limiting value fell outside one standard deviation of the inferred probability ( i . e . , for mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 , \u03bc > 0 . 75 and \u03bc \u2212 \u03c3 > 0 . 75 [predicting a \u20181\u2019] or \u03bc > 0 . 25 and \u03bc + \u03c3 < 0 . 25 [predicting a \u20180\u2019] ) , the prediction was presented as \u2018strict\u2019 . We used a dynamic programming approach to explore whether a deterministic sequence of events , with a trait Tn always being acquired at timestep n ( \u03c0i , n=\u03b4Tn , n ) , was compatible with the biological data . Performing an exhaustive search over sequences of single transitions that were compatible with the observed data , we identified several such sequences that accounted for all but one trait acquisition , but no single sequence exists that accounts for all the data . To explore the possibility of multiple traits being acquired simultaneously , we tracked acquisition probabilities for later traits given that a certain trait was acquired first . This tracking was performed over all sampled compatible networks , building up \u2018contingent\u2019 acquisition tables \u03b3 with the i , j th element given by \u2119 ( \u03c0j , 2|\u03c0i , 1=1 ) , \u2260i . If a pair of traits i and j were acquired simultaneously , we would expect \u03b3ij and \u03b3ji to both be higher than expected in the non-contingent case ( as j should always appear to be immediately acquired after i and vice versa ) . RNA was extracted from mature leaves of six Flaveria species as part of the One Thousand Plants Consortium ( www . onekp . com ) , using the hot acid phenol protocol as described by Johnson et al . ( 2012 ) ( protocol no . 12 ) . cDNA was synthesised from 0 . 5 \u00b5g RNA using Superscript II ( Life Technologies , Glasgow , U . K . ) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions . An oligo dT primer ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) was used to selectively transcribe polyadenylated transcripts . To each RNA sample , 1 fmol GUS transcript was added for use as an exogenous control or \u2018RNA spike\u2019 , against which measured transcript abundance was normalised as described by Smith et al . ( 2003 ) . qPCR was performed as described by Bustin ( 2000 ) using the DNA-binding marker SYBR Green ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Primers were designed using cDNA sequences for Flaveria species available at Genbank ( http:\/\/www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov\/genbank ) and synthesised by Life Technologies . Amplification was performed using a Rotor-Gene Q instrument ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , using the following cycling parameters: 94\u00b0C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 s , 60\u00b0C for 30 s , 72\u00b0C for 30 s , followed by a 5 min incubation at 72\u00b0C . Relative transcript abundance was calculated as described by Livak and Schmittgen ( 2001 ) .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Methods"],"keywords":["plant biology"],"id":"elife-00961-v1"}
{"lay_summary":"Proteins carry out diverse activities in our cells . These proteins are constantly being built according to accurate instructions , which are encoded on molecules named messenger RNAs ( mRNAs for short ) . The process of converting the instructions into proteins is called translation . Viruses infect host cells and take over the cellular machinery that is responsible for translation . This causes the cell to produce viral proteins at the expense of host proteins \u2013 a process called host shutoff . As a result , viral proteins take over the cell and the infection accelerates . There are two main strategies used by viruses to co-opt the cell\u2019s translation machinery: either host mRNAs are destroyed , or the machines that read mRNA molecules are manipulated to read only the viral instructions . Most viruses appear to dedicate themselves to using just one of these strategies . However , evidence suggests that the Influenza A virus uses both strategies to induce host shutoff . To investigate the extent to which each of the shutoff strategies is used by the Influenza A virus , Bercovich-Kinori , Tai et al . have studied infected human lung cells . This revealed that the virus primarily reduces the amount of host mRNA in the cells to take over the mRNA pool . The host mRNAs were affected by the infection to different extents . For example , the mRNAs that coded for proteins that perform important roles for the virus , such as produce energy , were not affected by the virus . A future challenge is to find out exactly how the Influenza A virus distinguishes between different cellular mRNAs . This knowledge may help to develop new treatments for flu .","article":"Host shutoff is a common strategy used by viruses to repress cellular mRNA translation and concomitantly allow the efficient translation of viral mRNAs . Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus ( IAV ) to induce host shutoff . We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool . Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction , revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV . Interestingly , these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation . Furthermore , we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation . Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff , and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions . \n Influenza A viruses ( IAV ) are included among the Orthomyxoviridae family of negative single-stranded , segmented RNA viruses . These viruses cause an infectious disease that constitutes an important public health problem and remains today an important cause of morbidity and mortality ( Fields , 2007 ) . Like all viruses , IAV is absolutely dependent on the host-cell protein synthesis machinery to produce its proteins . To ensure priority access to host translation machinery , many viruses utilize host shutoff mechanisms that eliminate competition from cellular transcripts ( Walsh et al . , 2012 ) . Host shutoff could be achieved by two complementary mechanisms: 1 . Direct co-opting of the translation machinery by mechanisms that force better translation of viral mRNAs compared to their host counterparts . A classic example for this strategy is employed by poliovirus . It cleaves an essential host cap- binding protein , eIF4G , therefore preventing cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs while viral RNA translation stays unperturbed through the use of an internal ribosome entry site ( Ventoso et al . , 1998 ) . 2 . Viral-induced degradation of host mRNAs . This strategy is employed by several herpesviruses that express endonucleases which cleave host mRNAs , thereby eliminating the competition with host mRNA for the translation apparatus and ensuring efficient cap-dependent translation of viral mRNAs ( Glaunsinger and Ganem , 2006 ) . IAV has long been known to significantly shutoff host gene expression . Interestingly , it is one of the few viruses for which both direct translation co-opting and host mRNA degradation were suggested to play a prominent role in host shutoff ( Yanguez and Nieto , 2011; Jagger et al . , 2012 ) . Although IAV mRNAs share the basic features with host mRNAs like a 5\u2019 7-methyl guanosine ( m7G ) cap and a 3\u2019 poly-adenylate ( poly ( A ) ) tail , previous research suggested that influenza mRNAs are preferably translated due to features found in the 5\u2019UTR of viral mRNAs ( Garfinkel and Katze , 1993; Katze et al . , 1986; Park and Katze , 1995 ) . In addition host mRNA degradation has long been acknowledged ( Beloso et al . , 1992 ) . The 5\u2019 m7G caps on viral transcripts are acquired by \u201ccap-snatching\u201d ( Plotch et al . , 1981 ) , this snatching allows the priming of viral mRNA synthesis but also leads to nascent host transcripts degradation . In addition , inhibition of polyadenylation of host pre-mRNA by IAV Nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1 ) protein ( Nemeroff et al . , 1998 ) , and degradation of the host RNA polymerase II complex ( Rodriguez and P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez , 2007 ) could contribute to the reduction in host transcripts in infected cells . Recently , a highly conserved IAV protein PA-X , possessing the PA endonuclease domain , was shown to selectively degrade host mRNAs ( Jagger et al . , 2012 ) , strongly suggesting that PA-X is a general influenza host shutoff endonuclease . Although the discovery of PA-X has prompted new examination of the mechanisms that drive host shutoff during IAV infection ( Khaperskyy\u00a0and\u00a0McCormick , 2015; Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 , 2014; Bavagnoli et al . , 2015 ) , several fundamental questions remain unanswered: ( a ) To what extent does IAV change host mRNAs expression and translation ? , ( b ) what is the relative contribution of host mRNA degradation versus direct manipulation of translation to host shutoff ? ( c ) to what extent does the virus possess mechanisms to ensure more effective translation of its own mRNAs ? Here , we took a systemic approach to explore the relative contribution of direct co-opting of the translation machinery , and reduction of host RNA levels to the reduction in host protein synthesis . To this end , we have used RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) and ribosome profiling ( deep sequencing of ribosomes-protected fragments ) to globally map the changes in host genes RNA and translation levels during IAV infection . These comprehensive and simultaneous measurements complemented with Single molecule Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization ( smFISH ) revealed that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels , and that IAV transcripts are not preferably translated . Our systematic analysis also reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and that the extent of mRNAs reduction is related to their length and GC content . Interestingly , we noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation related proteins are less affected by IAV infection , their protein levels remain stable throughout infection and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands that are essential for virus replication . \n To gain a detailed view of the changes that occur in viral and host transcripts abundance and translation over the course of IAV infection , we infected A549 cells with the A\/Puerto Rico\/8\/1934 H1N1 ( PR8 ) strain at MOI\u00a0=\u00a05 and harvested cells at 2 , 4 , and 8 hr post infection ( hpi ) . We designed our experiment to simultaneously monitor both RNA levels and translation ( Figure 1A ) . Deep sequencing of mRNA ( RNA-seq ) allows a detailed mapping of transcript levels during infection and these were paired with ribosome footprints , which allow accurate measurement of protein synthesis by capturing the overall in vivo distribution of ribosomes on a given message ( Ingolia et al . , 2011 ) . In order to assess the reproducibility of our experiments we prepared two independent biological replicates for each of these time points . Both the mRNA and footprints read density measurements were reproducible ( Figure 1B ) . We quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of 7211 human transcripts and the 8 viral transcripts that are expressed from the 8 genomic segments of influenza . Metagene analysis , in which gene profiles are aligned and then averaged , revealed the expected profiles of footprints along mRNAs; ribosome density accumulates along the gene body ending at the first in-frame stop codon with pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at the initiation and termination sites ( Figure 2A ) . Unexpectedly , examination of the ribosome profiling data obtained from influenza transcripts revealed reads that align to the IAV minus strand ( vRNA ) that is non-coding ( Figure 2B ) . These reads were not correlated with any sequence feature related to translation and were specific for the virus as individual human transcripts presented the expected profiles precluding any general problem in the sample preparation ( Figure 2C ) . To test if the footprints we obtained from viral mRNAs indeed originate from the ribosome protected fragments we generated an additional set of ribosome profiling libraries in which cells were pre-treated with harringtonine , a drug which leads to a strong accumulation of ribosomes precisely at translation initiation sites ( Ingolia et al . , 2011 ) . As expected harringtonine treatment led to strong accumulation of ribosome protected fragments at the first AUG and to the\u00a0depletion of ribosome density from the body of the viral and host mRNAs . Thus , this indicates that the protected fragments we captured from both cellular and viral mRNAs originate from ribosome protected fragments of transcripts that were engaged in active translation elongation ( Figure 2A , B and D ) . In contrast , the protected fragments that mapped to the IAV minus strand were not affected by harringtonine treatment ( Figure 2B and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) indicating that the protection of these fragments is probably not mediated by translating ribosomes . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 003Figure 1 .

In ribosome-profiling data , the overall size distribution of fragments derived from protein-coding sequences , differs from the lengths of contaminating fragments found in profiling samples ( Ingolia et al . , 2014 ) . We used a fragment length organization similarity score ( FLOSS ) that measures the magnitude of disagreement between the footprints distribution on a given transcript and the footprints distribution on canonical CDS . As expected thousands of well-expressed protein-coding transcripts scored well , and the similarity improved with increasing read counts ( [Ingolia et al . , 2014] and Figure 2E ) . IAV mRNAs scored well in these matrixes and they did not differ from well-expressed human transcripts ( Figure 2E , blue ) . However , reads from IAV minus strand could be clearly distinguished from annotated coding sequences ( Figure 2E , red ) . We conclude that the protected fragments originating from minus strand viral RNA are not generated by ribosome protection . These fragments could originate from protection by the viral nucleoprotein ( NP ) that associates with viral genomes and was shown to sediment with viral RNAs ( Duesberg , 1969 ) . This possibility is supported by the observation that the numbers of protected reads originating from the IAV genome increases as the infection progresses ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . In order to quantitatively evaluate if IAV evolved mechanisms to co-opt the cells' ribosomes we calculated the translation efficiency ( TE ) across our time course . TE is defined as the ratio of footprints to total mRNAs for a given gene and reflects how well a gene is being translated . We then compared the TE of human genes to that of viral genes at each of the time points along infection ( Figure 3A ) . The analysis shows that the viral genes translation efficiencies fall within the general range of host gene translation indicating that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated during IAV infection and that direct co-opting of the translation machinery does not play a dominant role in cellular gene shutoff . Instead , our systematic analysis demonstrates that host shutoff stems from the\u00a0viral dominance over the mRNA pool . At 8 hpi viral mRNAs take over 53 . 8% of the translation activity in the cells as 57 . 3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral ( Figure 3B ) . These findings show that the relative reduction in cellular mRNA expression is the main cause for host shutoff during infection . Our analysis concurs with the finding that PA-X endonuclease activity plays a dominant role in host shutoff during IAV infection ( Jagger et al . , 2012; Khaperskyy and McCormick , 2015; Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 , 2014; Bavagnoli et al . , 2015 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 007Figure 3 .

Lysates from A549 cells infected with\u00a0IAV and metabolically labeled for 30-min periods ending at the times shown were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 008 To confirm that our system indeed recapitulates the previous observations that IAV induces host shutoff ( Katze et al . , 1986; Skehel , 1972 ) , we monitored protein synthesis in IAV infected A549 cells by metabolic labelling . As was previously reported , also in our system IAV infection produced abundant quantities of virus polypeptides from 4 hpi and this was accompanied by reduced cellular protein synthesis ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Next we quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of cellular genes along IAV infection . Interestingly , 74% of host transcripts were reduced by more than three-fold in their footprints densities along infection , reflecting the drastic shutoff in host protein synthesis ( Supplementary file 1 ) . We compared the expression of the\u00a0infected samples to mock sample and clustered the mRNA and footprint ratios using partitioning clustering . This approach allowed clustering of the cellular transcripts into 4 distinct classes based on similarities in temporal expression profiles in the RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data . Overall , we found that changes in ribosome footprints tracked the changes in transcripts abundance ( Figure 3C ) , which is in line with host protein synthesis shutoff being driven by the in reduction cellular RNA levels and not by direct interference with the translation machinery . Interestingly , although the majority of host transcripts were significantly reduced during influenza infection , ( cluster 1 and cluster 4 , Figure 3C ) we identified numerous genes that were significantly elevated ( cluster 2 , Figure 3C ) and genes that were not significantly changed during influenza infection ( cluster 3 , Figure 3C ) . We next carried out GO term enrichment analysis for each of these four clusters . As expected the small group of upregulated mRNAs was significantly enriched with genes related to antiviral defense ( cluster 2 , Pval\u00a0=\u00a06 . 9E-13 ) , including Viperin and IDO1 that were previously shown to be elevated during IAV infection ( Ranaware et al . , 2016; Wang et al . , 2007; Huang et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , cluster 1 which is composed of mRNAs that are most drastically downregulated is enriched with genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle ( Pval\u00a0=\u00a01 . 7E-17 and Pval\u00a0=\u00a04 . 3E-18 respectively ) whereas cellular mRNAs that are barely affected by IAV infection ( cluster 3 ) are enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and for transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins ( Pval\u00a0=\u00a03 . 4E-10 and Pval\u00a0=\u00a03 . 9E-8 , respectively ) . These measurements and analysis reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is mainly driven by reduction in cellular mRNA levels , and that host mRNAs sensitivity to influenza is not uniform and certain mRNAs are more resistant to viral interference . One limitation of global deep-sequencing measurements is that these measurements provide relative but not absolute quantification of RNA and translation levels . To address this issue we confirmed that there are no significant changes in the overall levels of translation ( Figure 4B and Katze et al . , 1986 ) and in total RNA ( Supplementary file 2 ) along IAV infection . We also extracted RNA from an\u00a0equal number of cells along infection and performed real-time PCR analysis for cellular mRNAs from each of these clusters . These independent measurements were in strong agreement with our RNA-seq measurements ( Figure 3D ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 009Figure 4 .

A representative analysis of two independent experiments is shownDOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 009 To quantitatively evaluate if there are genes that are differently translated along IAV infection , we used a computational framework named Babel ( Olshen et al . , 2013 ) . This analysis quantifies levels of ribosome occupancy higher or lower than those predicted from transcript abundance . In total , this approach allowed us to identify 210 cellular mRNAs that are differentially translated following IAV infection ( Pval<0 . 01 , Supplementary file 3 ) . Among these , 125 genes were translationally upregulated whereas 85 genes were translationally down regulated . While Go enrichment analysis did not reveal any significant functional category , we noticed that within the group of translationally upregulated genes at 4 hpi , there was an enrichment for genes that were previously shown as translationally induced in conditions in which eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 ( eIF2\u03b1 ) is phosphorylated ( pval<0 . 002 , [Andreev et al . , 2015; Sidrauski et al . , 2015] ) . eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is a stress response that reduces overall protein synthesis while enhancing the\u00a0translation of specific transcripts whose products support adaptive stress responses . By performing western blot analysis , we show that at 4 hpi eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is apparent and only at 8 hpi it is drastically reduced ( Figure 4A ) . By analyzing polysome profiles prepared from uninfected and IAV infected cells at 4 hpi , we confirmed that IAV infection indeed induce the translation of UCP2 and RALGDS ( two genes that are also translationally induced following stress induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [Andreev et al . , 2015] ) , but not that of control genes SOX4 and SF3B5 for which no change in translation was observed ( Figure 4C and Supplementary file 3 ) . These results demonstrate that although IAV blocks eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation ( Goodman et al . , 2007 ) , at 4 hpi eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation affects the\u00a0cellular translation . In addition , these findings provide another confirmation for the accuracy of our translation measurements . Our global measurements implied that host shutoff is driven by the high levels of IAV mRNAs that outnumber cellular transcripts , and that some cellular mRNAs are less affected by IAV . We wanted to preclude normalization issues and to validate these observations using an independent quantification method that provides absolute measurements . To this end , we used the smFISH technique that enables visualization of single mRNA molecules in fixed cells ( Raj et al . , 2008 ) . This technique relies on the specific hybridization of short DNA libraries that are coupled to a fluorophore and are complementary to a specific target mRNA sequence . Binding of multiple probes to the same transcript yields a bright dot , indicative of a single mRNA molecule . This method has been used in various systems allowing accurate quantification of mRNA molecules per cell ( Itzkovitz , 2011 ) . We quantified the expression of four human mRNAs , two mRNAs that are significantly reduced during influenza infection ( CHML and KIF18A , cluster 1 ) and two mRNAs that were less affected by infection ( MYC and CDKN1B , cluster 3 ) . We also tested the expression of one viral transcript , Hemagglutinin ( HA ) . We designed a panel of fluorescently labeled probes , each composed of 48 20-base oligos complementary to the coding sequences of each of these genes . We used A549 cells that were left uninfected or IAV infected and then fixed at 2 , 4 , and 8 hpi . Hybridization of these cells with the fluorescently labeled probes libraries yielded bright diffraction-limited dots , representing single transcripts . These were automatically counted using a custom image-processing software ( Bahar Halpern , 2016 ) . Importantly , when we examined HA expression in uninfected cells we did not detect any diffraction-limited dots demonstrating the specificity of this approach ( Figure 5A ) . Following infection with IAV , HA transcript levels were drastically elevated and at 8 hpi the intensity of the smFISH signal was too high to measure single dots ( Figure 5A ) . The expression levels of the four cellular transcripts we measured by smFISH were highly correlated with our RNA-seq measurements ( Figure 5A and B ) . These absolute quantifications of viral and host transcripts along IAV infection strongly support the notion that host shutoff is mainly driven by differences in mRNA levels . Furthermore , this data illustrates the variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction during IAV infection , suggesting that IAV-mediated degradation might act differently on different cellular transcripts . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 010Figure 5 . smFISH measurments of cellular mRNAs along IAV infection . ( A ) mRNA detection by Single molecule FISH ( smFISH ) was performed on A549 cells , either mock infected or 8 hpi .

Transcript\u2019s GC content ( left ) and length distribution ( right ) were calculated for genes encoding ribosomal proteins and respiration components , for genes in cluster 3 after omitting these functional categories ( cluster 3* ) and for clusters 1 and 4 presented in Figure 3C ( representing differential response to IAV infection ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 012 Multiple mechanisms for IAV interference with cellular RNA expression have been described ( Nemeroff et al . , 1998;\u00a0Fortes et al . , 1994;\u00a0Rodriguez et al . , 2007; Plotch et al . , 1981 ) , all of which involve interference with processes occurring in the nucleus . The discovery of the highly conserved RNA endonuclease , PA-X , implied for the existence of cytoplasmic degradation machinery , since viral RNAses from other viruses were proposed to act in the cytoplasm ( Abernathy , 2015 ) . However , recent work presented evidence that PA-X activity might be restricted to the nucleus ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 ) . On top of absolute quantification , smFISH also provides spatial information about mRNA molecule distribution in the cell . This allowed us to test the levels of endogenous cellular transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm along influenza infection . We quantified the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of CHML and KIF8A , which showed a\u00a0drastic reduction in their levels , and of MYC that showed subtler but still a\u00a0significant reduction ( Figure 5B ) . Interestingly , the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of CHML , KIF18A and MYC were downregulated to the same extent ( Figure 5C ) . These results strongly suggest that interference in cellular RNA expression along IAV infection occurs mainly in the nucleus . We noticed that cellular genes respond differently to IAV infection and can be divided based on the level of reduction they present during infection ( Figure 3C , clusters 1 , 3 and 4 ) . Hence , we were interested in the features differentiating between these cellular mRNA groups . If IAV interference with cellular transcript expression occurs mainly in the nucleus and there is no selectivity in this process then the decline in mRNA levels should be correlated with the cytoplasmic half-lives of mRNAs . Using recent measurements of mRNA half-lives in A549 cells ( Maekawa et al . , 2015 ) we identified a significant enrichment in mRNAs with long half-lives in cluster 3 , which includes genes that were only mildly affected by IAV infection ( Figure 5D , Pval\u00a0=\u00a00 . 005 ) , but this cluster contained also many genes with short half-life . These results suggest that there are additional features that govern the differences between these clusters , and that the differences in the levels of reduction might stem from differences in IAV-interference with host genes expression . Since our measurements suggested that most of the\u00a0IAV-mediated reduction occurs in the nucleus and a recent study connected PA-X activity to the 3\u2019 end processing ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 ) , we tested whether the length of the poly-A tail affects the extent to which mRNAs are reduced after IAV infection . Using genome wide measurements of poly-A tail length ( Chang et al . , 2014 ) we did not observe any significant differences between the different clusters ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We next examined specific characteristics of the corresponding transcripts , including their length and GC content . Interestingly , both mRNA length and GC content showed a significant difference between the clusters , and the transcripts that were less affected by IAV were significantly shorter and had higher GC content ( Figure 5E and 5F , Pval\u22641 . 49e-63 and Pval\u22643 . 636e-06 , respectively ) . Since cluster 3 ( composed of genes that were less affected by IAV ) is also significantly enriched in transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal proteins , and these functional categories are composed of genes that tend to be short ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , we wanted to exclude the possibility that the reduced length we observed is indirectly driven by the enrichment in these functional categories . Indeed , also after omitting transcripts related to these functional categories cluster 3 transcripts were significantly shorter ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that shorter and more structured transcripts ( transcripts with higher GC content ) tend to be less affected by IAV infection and therefore it is likely that the extent to which cellular mRNAs are degraded is at least partially governed by the quantity of exposed single stranded RNA in the nucleus . Host shutoff mechanisms clearly provide advantages for viruses as they hamper the cellular response to infection and limit competition for cellular ribosomes . However , dampening cellular gene expression also poses a big challenge , as viruses are fully dependent on cellular resources such as macromolecules\u2019 building blocks , energy production and the host translational machinery . Therefore , the observation that transcripts coding for ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation proteins , are less reduced following IAV infection , implies that the translation maintenance of these cellular pathways might be important for IAV infection . To validate this notion we conducted western blot analysis on cell extracts along IAV infection and could confirm the stable expression of components of the respiratory complex ( Figure 6A , upper panel ) , whereas other proteins were reduced following IAV infection ( Figure 6A , lower panel ) . In accordance with these results , by staining infected cells with the potential sensitive mitochondrial stain Tetramethylrhodamine ( TMRM ) , we show that the mitochondria membrane potential is not affected by IAV infection ( Figure 6B ) . Next we tested if continuous oxidative phosphorylation is important for IAV propagation by employing drugs that interfere with the function of the\u00a0respiratory chain . We used either the ionophore Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone ( CCCP ) or Valinomycin that chelates potassium ions , both causing a collapses of the mitochondria membrane potential . When cells were infected for 2 hr and then treated with CCCP or Valinomycin in concentrations that did not affect cell viability ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , IAV titers were significantly reduced ( Figure 6C and D ) . Overall , these results indicate that mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation are less perturbed by IAV infection , and that maintenance of intact oxidative phosphorylation activity during IAV infection is important for viral replication . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 013Figure 6 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 18311 . 014 \n Many viruses have developed varied and sophisticated mechanisms to specifically repress cellular mRNA translation and concomitantly allow the selective translation of viral mRNA . In the case of IAV many mechanisms were suggested to contribute to the observed host shutoff . These include: 1 . Cap-snatching of cellular pre-mRNAs ( Plotch et al . , 1981 ) , 2 . Inhibition of cellular pre-mRNAs polyadenylation ( Nemeroff et al . , 1998 ) , 3 . Degradation of RNA Polymerase II ( Rodriguez and P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez , 2007 ) , 4 . Nuclear retention of cellular mRNAs ( Fortes and Beloso , 1994 ) , 5 . Cellular mRNAs degradation ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016; Beloso et al . , 1992; Inglis , 1982 ) and 6 . Preferential translation of viral mRNAs ( Yanguez and So similar , 2011; Garfinkel and Katze , 1993; Katze et al . , 1986 ) . Our systematic and unbiased analysis surprisingly demonstrates that viral mRNAs are not preferentially translated compared to their host counterparts and that the extensive translation of viral proteins is the result of viral takeover of the mRNA pool in the cell . These results are consistent with the notion that NS1 is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production ( Salvatore et al . , 2002 ) and that PA-X endonuclease activity is a dominant factor in mediating host shutoff activity ( Jagger et al . , 2012; Khaperskyy\u00a0and\u00a0McCormick , 2015; Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 , 2014; Bavagnoli et al . , 2015 ) . It should be noted that at 8 hpi there is already extensive viral replication ( evident from the strong increase in reads originating from the viral minus strand ) . Therefore , at this time point a portion of the viral RNA plus strand we measured are used as a\u00a0template for replication ( cRNA ) and not as mRNAs . Since our calculation of viral transcripts TE is based on dividing the number of footprints by the number of corresponding RNA reads it is possible that we underestimate the TE of viral genes at this time point . However , using our smFISH measurements for viral transcript we could show that >90% of the plus strand viral RNA is located in the cytoplasm . Therefore , this potential bias could result in a\u00a0maximum of 10% effect that does not hamper our conclusions . Previous studies demonstrated inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation during influenza infection and it was proposed that this inhibition is mediated by the activation of the cellular inhibitor of PKR , P58-IPK ( Goodman et al . , 2007 ) . Our analysis supports the observation that IAV infection inhibit eIF2a phosphorylation but we show that this inhibition is not immediate . In our experimental system eIF2a was phosphorylated at 4 hpi and this stress response affects the expression of cellular genes ( Figure 4 ) . Since our measurements suggest the P58-IPK ( DNAJC3 ) expression is reduced during IAV infection ( by three-fold ) it is possible that other mechanisms also contribute to the inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation . Due to library normalization , it is challenging to assess from the\u00a0ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq measurements on overall virus-induced host shutoff . To address this inherent limitation , we used smFISH , which allows absolute quantification of transcript levels in single cells . Our smFISH measurements correlated well with our global RNA quantification confirming our data and findings . In addition , our smFISH measurements show that after IAV infection RNA levels of endogenous cellular transcripts are reduced to a similar extent in the nucleus and the cytoplasm . This observation suggests that cellular mRNAs degradation occurs in the nucleus but it could also be explained by blockage of transcription in conjunction to cytoplasmic degradation that reduces cytoplasmic mRNA levels . The recent observation that PA-X activity is mostly nuclear ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 ) together with limited correlation with a cytoplasmic half-life strongly points to the former possibility . Our analysis also allowed us to quantify the reduction in cellular mRNAs along IAV infection , revealing that the extent of reduction varies between different transcripts . The magnitude of reduction could only be partially explained by cytoplasmic half-life and interestingly the extent of reduction was significantly correlated with transcript\u2019s length and GC content . Since cap-snatching activity was shown to target mostly small nuclear RNAs ( Koppstein et al . , 2015 ) , it is likely that the majority of the observed differential reduction in cellular mRNAs is driven by PA-X degradation activity . Therefore , the relation to the\u00a0length and GC content strongly points to a non-selective process of degradation , where the chances of a transcript to be degraded are influenced by the quantity of exposed ssRNA . This notion is consistent with existing in-vitro data showing PA-X preference to ssRNA ( Bavagnoli et al . , 2015 ) and with the findings that PA-X lacks obvious sequence or location specificity ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 ) . However , the notion that IAV induced degradation significantly depends on the length of the transcript does not easily reconcile with the evidence that PA-X specifically targets Pol II transcripts and that this specificity is connected to 3\u2019 end processing ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 ) . One way these results could be rationalized is if Pol II transcription and processing is physically limited to specific sub-nuclear compartments ( Mitchell , 2008; Ghamari et al . , 2013 ) . In this case , the specificity of PA-X to Pol II transcripts could originate from physical proximity , while the recognition itself could be random and depends on the length and GC content , which will govern the amount of exposed ssRNA . Another possibility is that degradation activity is coupled to mRNA splicing . This can explain the specificity to Pol II transcripts and the relative resistance of short transcripts which intrinsically also tend to have less exons . However , this possibility seems less favorable as at least by over expression PA-X did not affect the expression of cellular nascent transcripts ( Khaperskyy et al . , 2016 ) . Future work focused on PA-X activity can help shed light on the exact mechanism . Host shutoff is a common phenomenon , employed by diverse viruses and it is thought to contribute to the\u00a0viral progression in two main ways: by redirecting the translation machinery towards viral gene expression and by inhibiting cellular anti-viral responses . However , shutting off cellular protein production could also have adverse effects . Viruses are completely dependent on cellular resources and inhibiting cellular protein production can dampen processes that are indispensable for the virus . Interestingly , we noticed that transcripts that are less affected by IAV infection are enriched for genes involved in pathways that the virus potentially depends on , such as oxidative phosphorylation components and ribosomal proteins . In contrast , genes that were most significantly reduced are related to cell cycle , a cellular activity that is often blocked by viruses . Indeed , we were able to show that the levels of mitochondrial proteins are not affected by IAV even at 16 hpi , a time point in which other proteins were reduced . Further experiments demonstrated that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation to levels that do not affect cell\u2019s viability severely impairs viral replication . These results suggest that continuous expression of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation is important for viral propagation . Since viruses mostly interfere with protein synthesis , the level of protein reduction during infection is also tightly connected to the half-life of these proteins . In this regard , the observation that many of the proteins that perform basic cellular functions like translation and cellular respiration have long half-lives ( Schwanhausser et al . , 2011 ) could also assist viruses to avoid detrimental damage from shutting-off cellular protein synthesis . The inherent difficulties in blocking host protein production should be common to other viruses inducing host shutoff , particularly viruses with long infection cycle . It will therefore be interesting to see whether other viruses that interfere with cellular protein synthesis will also do this in a differential manner , facilitating the maintenance of cellular functions that are important for viral propagation . It is well acknowledged that ribosome profiling is an emerging technique that allows probing of translation systematically and with increased sensitivity . This method in conjunction with RNA-seq was previously used to map the changes that occur in host gene expression during herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections ( Rutkowski et al . , 2015; Tirosh et al . , 2015 ) and to probe the complexity of several viruses ( Stern-Ginossar et al . , 2012; Arias et al . , 2014; Yang et al . , 2015; Irigoyen et al . , 2016 ) . Here we show how these methods in conjunction with smFISH could be used to accurately quantify host shutoff along viral infection . These unbiased and systematic quantification methods can advance our understanding of viral interference with host protein production and are applicable to infection with any virus . \n The cells used in this study were the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 . The human influenza viruses A\/Puerto Rico\/8\/34 H1N1 used in this study were generated as previously described ( Achdout et al . , 2003 ) . Cells were grown on 10\u00a0cm2 plates and were infected at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 5 . Efficiency of infection was determined by immunofluorescence with Influenza A antibody FITC Reagent ( LIGHT DIAGNOSTIC ) followed by DAPI dye for nuclear staining , and confirmed that >95% of cells were infected . Viral genomic RNA was quantified by extracting RNA from the\u00a0supernatant by using the NucliSENS easyMAG ( BioMerieux , France ) . Detection of influenza A virus infection was performed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR ( rRT-PCR ) , using TaqMan Chemistry on the ABI 7500 instrument as previously described ( Hindiyeh et al . , 2005 ) . Cycloheximide treatments were carried out as previously described ( Stern-Ginossar et al . , 2012 ) . Cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 20\u00a0mM Tris 7 . 5 , 150\u00a0mM NaCl , 5\u00a0mM MgCl2 , 1\u00a0mM dithiothreitol , 8% glycerol ) supplemented with 0 . 5% triton , 30 U\/ml Turbo DNase ( Ambion ) and 100\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml cycloheximide , ribosome protected fragments were then generated as previously described ( Stern-Ginossar et al . , 2012 ) . Total RNA was isolated from infected cells using Tri-Reagent ( Sigma ) . Polyadenylated RNA was purified from total RNA sample using an\u00a0Oligotex mRNA mini kit ( Qiagen ) . The resulting mRNA was modestly fragmented by partial hydrolysis in bicarbonate buffer so that the average size of fragments would be ~80\u00a0bp . The fragmented mRNA was separated by denaturating PAGE and fragments 50\u201380 nt were selected and sequencing libraries were made as previously described ( Stern-Ginossar et al . , 2012 ) . Prior to alignment , linker and polyA sequences were removed from the 3\u2019 ends of reads . Bowtie v0 . 12 . 7 ( allowing up to 2 mismatches ) was used to perform the alignments . First , reads that aligned to human rRNA sequences were discarded . All remaining reads were aligned to the concatenated viral ( EF467817 - EF467824 ) and human ( hg19 ) genomes . Finally , still-unaligned reads were aligned to the human known canonical transcriptome that includes splice junctions . Reads with unique alignments were used to compute the total number of reads at each position . Footprints and mRNA densities were calculated in units of reads per kilobase per million ( RPKM ) in order to normalize for gene length and total reads per sequencing run . The expression patterns were examined for genes that had more than 150 uniquely aligned reads of mRNA and footprints . Partitioning clustering was performed using Partek Genomic suits across mRNA and footprint data . GO enrichment analysis was done using DAVID database ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . The Babel computational framework was used to quantitatively evaluate if there are genes that are differently translated along the\u00a0IAV infection ( Olshen et al . , 2013 ) . Infected A549 cells ( mock , 2 hpi , 4 hpi , 8 hpi ) were incubated in methionine depleted DMEM for 30 min . Subsequently , 50 \u00b5Ci\/mL [35S]-methionine was added and incubated for 30 min . Cells were harvested using RIPA buffer . Lysates were run on a polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gradient gel ( 4\u201312% ) . The PAA gel was fixed overnight in a fixation solution ( 3% glycerol , 20% methanol , 7% acetic acid ) . Typhoon FLA 7000 from GE Healthcare Life Sciences was used for acquisition . Four hours post infection A549 cells were treated with 100 \u00b5g\/ml Cycloheximide for 1 min and then washed twice with cold PBS containing 100 \u00b5g\/ml Cycloheximide . The cells were collected and lyzed with 400 \u00b5l lysis buffer ( 20\u00a0mM Tris 7 . 5 , 150\u00a0mM NaCl , 5\u00a0mM MgCl2 , 1mM dithiothereitol ) supplemented with 0 . 5% triton , 30\u00a0U\/ml Turbo DNase ( Ambion ) and 100 \u00b5g\/ml Cycloheximide . The lyzed samples were centrifuged at 12 , 000\u00a0g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min . The cleared lysates were loaded onto 10\u201350% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 35 , 000 RPM in a SW41 rotor for 3 hr at 4\u00b0C . Gradients were fractionated and the optical density at 254 nm was continuously recorded using Biocomp gradient station . RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent ( Sigma ) and Direc-Zol RNA mini-prep kits ( Zymo Research ) . cDNA was prepared from 1\u00b5g RNA except for polysomes profiling experiments in which 255\u00a0ng RNA was used with High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( ABI ) . Real time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR master-mix ( ABI ) on a real-time PCR system StepOnePlus ( life technologies ) with the following primers: Probe library constructions , hybridization procedures , and imaging conditions were described previously ( Itzkovitz , 2011 ) . In short , probe libraries consisted of 48 probes of length 20 bases , were coupled to cy5 ( for MYC , and KIF18A ) or Alexa594 ( for CDKN1B , HA and CHML ) . Hybridizations were performed overnight in 30\u00b0C . DAPI dye for nuclear staining was added during the washes . Images were taken with a Nikon Ti-E inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a \u00d7100 oilimmersion objective and a Photometrics Pixis 1024 CCD camera using MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices , Downington , PA ) . Quantification was done on stacks of 10\u201315 optical sections , with Z spacing of 0 . 2 \u03bcm . The FLOSS score was computed as previously described ( Ingolia et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , a histogram of read lengths for all footprints that aligned to a specific transcript or reading frame was calculated and compared to a reference histogram produced by summing individual raw counts ( without normalization ) for annotated nuclear transcripts . The transcripts composing the clusters presented in Figure 3C were analyzed . For each cluster , we examined recently published data of RNA half-life in A549 cells ( Maekawa et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , we examined the mean poly ( A ) tail length from measurements that were performed in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells ( Chang et al . , 2014 ) . Transcripts length and GC content were calculated excluding introns . For each feature , pairs of clusters were compared using a two-sided t-test except for RNA half-life in which the clusters were compared using the Mann-Whitney test . Presented is the largest p-value of the three comparisons . Infected A549 cells and the mock control were harvested 2 hpi , 4 hpi 8 hpi , 12 hpi\u00a0and 16 hpi using RIPA Buffer .

Primary antibodies UQCRC2 , SDHB , COXII ( ab110413 , Abcam ) , PKN2 ( ab32395 , Abcam ) , ACTIN ( A4700 , Sigma Aldrich ) , eIF2\u03b1 ( sc-11386 , Santa Cruz ) and phosphorylated ( S52 ) eIF2\u03b1 ( 447286 , Invitrogen ) were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA TBST and incubated for 1 hr at RT or over night at 4\u00b0C . Secondary antibodies IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit ( LIC-92668071 ) and IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse ( LIC-92668070 ) were diluted 1:10000 in 5% skim milk TBST and incubated for 1 hr at RT . Acquisition was performed using , Odyssey CLx from LI-COR . A549 cells were treated after 2 hpi ( IAV ) with CCCP ( untreated , 10 \u00b5M or 20 \u00b5M ) or Valinomycin ( untreated , 1 \u00b5M , 2 . 5 \u00b5M ) . For Tetramethylrhodamine ( TMRM ) staining A549 cells were incubated with 20 nM TMRM in 1ml of DMEM for 30 min at 37\u00b0C , prior analysis in the flow cytometer . For PI ( propidium iodide ) staining , target cells were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L PBS and 10 \u00b5L staining solution ( 10 \u00b5g\/mL PI in PBS ) was added for 1 min prior to acquisition in the flow cytometer .

{"lay_summary":"The cycle of day and night is one of the most recurrent and predictable environmental changes on our planet . Consequently , organisms have evolved mechanisms that allow them to measure time over 24 hours and prepare for the periodic changes between light and dark . These mechanisms , known as circadian clocks , alter the activity of some of the organism\u2019s genes in a rhythmic way across the course of a day . This in turn causes certain behaviors and biological activities of the organism to follow a daily cycle . The bacterium Synechococcus elongatus needs to be able to track the daily cycle of light and dark because it performs photosynthesis and depends on sunlight to form sugars , which can later be broken down to release energy . The time information encoded in the circadian clock of S . elongatus is transmitted to the protein RpaA , which drives the regular circadian changes in gene activity in the cell . If RpaA is removed from the cell or prevented from working , S . elongatus can no longer control rhythmic gene activity and is unable to survive the night . To better understand how the circadian system schedules biological tasks to help an organism to survive , Puszynska and O'Shea studied S . elongatus cells . This revealed that the bacteria normally prepare for darkness by storing sugars during the day and activating several genes at dusk to make enzymes that are required to break down stored sugars . This provides the cells with energy that they need to survive the night . But mutant cells that lack the gene that produces RpaA do not prepare for darkness; they do not accumulate a store of sugars during the day or activate the vital genes at dusk . They have low internal energy levels in the dark and they cannot survive long periods of darkness . Providing the mutant cells with sugar and restoring the activity of the genes responsible for breaking down sugar enabled the cells to maintain energy in darkness and survive the night . It therefore appears that one role of the circadian system of S . elongatus is to coordinate building up sugar reserves during the day with breaking down sugar stores to generate energy during the night . Puszynska and O'Shea also found many other genes that are not activated at dusk in the mutant cells . It will therefore be important to study whether other pathways that help cells to survive and grow are defective in these mutant cells .","article":"The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription in cyanobacteria , driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance . Deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions , but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate . We investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect , and demonstrate that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night , does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day , and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night . Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light\/dark cycling conditions . Our observations highlight how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations . \n Organisms across kingdoms of life have evolved circadian clocks to temporally align biological activities with the diurnal changes in the environment . In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 , the core circadian oscillator is comprised of the KaiA , KaiB and KaiC proteins ( Nishiwaki et al . , 2007; Rust et al . , 2007 ) that generate oscillations in the phosphorylation state of KaiC . Time information encoded in the phosphorylation state of KaiC is transmitted to the transcription factor RpaA ( Takai et al . , 2006; Taniguchi et al . , 2010; Markson et al . , 2013 ) to generate circadian changes in gene expression ( Markson et al . , 2013 ) . In continuous light , the expression of more than 60% of protein-coding genes in S . elongatus is regulated in a circadian manner ( Vijayan et al . , 2009 ) with two main phases of gene expression: genes peaking at subjective dawn or subjective dusk , where the term \u2018subjective\u2019 refers to an internal estimate of time in the absence of external cues . Deletion of rpaA disrupts these rhythms in mRNA abundance and arrests cells in a subjective dawn-like transcriptional state , rendering them unable to switch to a subjective dusk-like expression program ( Markson et al . , 2013 ) . While it is clear that the circadian transcriptional program schedules timing of gene expression when the clock is free-running in the absence of changes in external light , it is unclear how circadian control of gene expression is used under more physiologically relevant conditions when light and dark periods alternate . Exposure to darkness restricts energy availability , creating unique metabolic demands in cyanobacteria which depend on sunlight for energy production through photosynthesis . Strikingly , the rpaA-\u00a0strain exhibits defects in cell growth and viability in cyclic , but not in constant light environments ( Takai et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting an important role for circadian regulation of gene expression in alternating light\/dark cycles . We find that both accumulation and utilization of the carbon reserves required for energy production during periods of darkness are defective in the rpaA- strain , and that correction of these defects restores viability . Our results provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment . \n As reported previously ( Takai et al . , 2006 ) , in constant light wild type and\u00a0the rpaA- cells grow at the same rate ( Figure 1A , top panel ) ; however , the rpaA- strain is not viable when cultured in alternating light\/dark conditions ( Figure 1A , bottom panel and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The rpaA- strain rapidly loses viability when incubated in the dark ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting that the defect is induced by darkness and not by repeated light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions . Complementation of the rpaA- strain with rpaA expressed from an ectopic site in the genome fully restores viability ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . In wild type cells , expression of the kaiBC genes depends on RpaA and thus deletion of rpaA abrogates the function of the KaiABC oscillator , altering the stoichiometry of the core clock proteins and abrogating the rhythms in KaiC phosphorylation ( Takai et al . , 2006 ) . To establish whether the defect in viability during dark periods results from loss of Kai oscillator function or from loss of RpaA function , we performed viability experiments using the \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain background in which kaiBC expression is made independent of RpaA ( Teng et al . , 2013 ) . We observed that the rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain phenocopies the rpaA- strain and the isogenic rpaA+ \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain phenocopies wild type strain , demonstrating that the viability defect stems from the loss of RpaA function and not from loss of Kai oscillator function ( Figure 1B and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 23210 . 003Figure 1 .

We examined the viability of the OX-D53E and OX-D53A strains , which lack both kaiBC and rpaA and contain a phosphomimetic form of RpaA expressed from an IPTG-inducible Ptrc promoter ( Markson et al . , 2013 ) . In these strains RpaA phosphorylation is not controlled by either the clock activity or by any other potential input factor , isolating RpaA activity from its regulators . We observed that expression of the RpaA D53E phosphomimetic restores viability in light\/dark conditions , while expression of the RpaA D53A variant does not ( Figure 1C ) . We also compared growth of the\u00a0cRpaA strain ( subscript \u2018c\u2019 denotes constitutive , RpaA-independent expression; see Materials and methods ) with the\u00a0cRpaA D53A strain , each made using the \u2018clock rescue\u2019 background , in light\/dark cycles . We found that while the control\u00a0cRpaA strain grows under these conditions despite lower levels of RpaA driven by the constitutive promoter , the cRpaA D53A strain is inviable ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D and E ) . We conclude that the active DNA-binding form of RpaA is necessary and sufficient for cell viability during exposure to light\/dark conditions . We next analyzed the role of the core KaiABC clock in sustaining viability of cyanobacterial cells in light\/dark conditions . Deletion of the kaiBC operon leads to only a minor viability defect in light\/dark conditions ( Boyd et al . , 2013 and Figure 1D ) and substantial RpaA phosphorylation levels were observed in the kaiBC- strain at the subjective dawn ( CT\u00a0=\u00a02 hr ) and afternoon ( CT\u00a0=\u00a09 hr ) in constant light conditions ( Boyd et al . , 2013 ) . Since RpaA phosphorylation levels are regulated by the antagonistic activities of two clock-controlled histidine kinases , SasA and CikA , and complexes of KaiB and KaiC proteins activate the phosphatase activity of CikA in vitro ( Gutu and O'Shea , 2013 ) , we hypothesized that RpaA would remain highly phosphorylated throughout the light\/dark cycle in the kaiBC- strain . In agreement with this prediction , when we analyzed RpaA phosphorylation in the kaiBC- mutant we detected high levels of RpaA phosphorylation both in light and in the dark ( Figure 1E ) . Thus , the ability of the kaiBC- mutant to survive alternating periods of light and dark likely stems from the high levels of phosphorylated RpaA in this strain . While the kaiBC operon is not essential for cell viability in light\/dark cycles , specific KaiC phosphoforms , whose relative abundances vary during the circadian cycle ( Rust et al . , 2007 ) , may have different effects on RpaA phosphorylation and , consequently , affect the ability of cells to survive light\/dark cycling conditions . We tested this hypothesis by analyzing cell viability and RpaA phosphorylation in strains expressing KaiC point mutants: KaiC-AA ( KaiC S431A T432A ) , representing the unphosphorylated phosphoform of KaiC , and KaiC-EE ( KaiC S431E T432E ) , representing the hyperphosphorylated KaiC variant . We used the P0050 promoter , which releases KaiC and RpaA expression from circadian feedback , to ensure equal expression of KaiC variants as well as of RpaA between the phosphomimetic strains ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We observed that while the cKaiC-AA mutant is viable in light\/dark conditions , the cKaiC-EE strain is not able to grow ( Figure 1F ) . Strikingly , the cKaiC-AA strain maintains high RpaA phosphorylation levels during the diurnal cycle , while RpaA is phosphorylated in\u00a0the cKaiC-EE\u00a0strain only at a low level ( Figure 1G ) . This ability to control RpaA phosphorylation and cell viability through perturbations in KaiC phosphorylation status underscores the primacy of this regulatory axis in the diurnal control of RpaA phosphorylation , and suggests that any hypothetical clock-independent environmental factors play a lesser role in regulating RpaA phosphorylation under the conditions we tested . Circadian clocks and their output synchronize the metabolic activity of cells with diurnal fluctuations ( Tu and McKnight , 2006; Green et al . , 2008; Graf et al . , 2010; Dodd et al . , 2015 ) . To understand if the observed viability defect stems from an inability of the rpaA- strain ( which is arrested in a \u2018dawn-like\u2019 transcriptional state [Markson et al . , 2013] ) to meet the metabolic requirements of darkness , we assessed cellular energy charge in wild type and the rpaA- strain over time in constant light conditions and in light\/dark cycles . Energy charge describes the relative levels of ATP , ADP and AMP in the intracellular adenine nucleotide pool , and is a tightly controlled parameter that reflects the global metabolic energy status of the cell ( Atkinson , 1968 ) . In constant light , there was no difference in energy charge between wild type and the rpaA-\u00a0strain ( Figure 2 , top panel ) . Wild type cells subjected to darkness experience only a slight reduction in energy charge ( Figure 2 , bottom panel , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , rpaA- cells experience a reduction in energy charge during the first dark period and an even more dramatic reduction during the second dark period , suggesting that this strain has a defect in energy metabolism affecting energy maintenance during the dark phase of the light\/dark cycle ( Figure 2 , bottom panel , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . The decrease in energy charge was accompanied by a reduction in the total adenine nucleotide pool size in the rpaA- strain ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . A similar trend has been previously observed during starvation in carbon-limited cultures of E . coli ( Chapman et al . , 1971 ) , prompting us to analyze changes in activity through pathways relevant for carbon metabolism in the strain lacking rpaA . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 23210 . 006Figure 2 .

To investigate the role of RpaA in orchestrating diurnal transcription of metabolic genes , we performed RNA sequencing in the rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain and an isogenic rpaA+ strain after exposure to darkness . The expression of circadian dusk-peaking genes was most affected in the rpaA deletion strain exposed to darkness ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Specifically , we observed that genes encoding enzymes involved in glycogen breakdown , glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 1 ) , which normally peak in expression at dusk , are among the genes with the greatest defect in expression in the rpaA- cells ( Figure 3A ) . These pathways are key for carbon utilization and energy production in the dark in cyanobacteria ( Figure 3B ) , and their function is essential for survival of periods of darkness ( Doolittle and Singer , 1974 ) . Independent deletion of gnd as well as the glgP_gap1 and fbp_zwf_opcA operons , which exhibit severely reduced expression in the rpaA- strain , results in impaired viability in light\/dark cycles but not in constant light conditions ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and Doolittle and Singer , 1974; Scanlan et al . , 1995 ) . We also measured expression of the key dusk metabolic genes , gnd , glgP and zwf , in the kaiBC- strain at dusk and in the first hours of darkness ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We observed that these genes are expressed at a high level , further emphasizing the role of phosphorylated RpaA in activation of the dusk transcriptional program and maintenance of cell viability in light\/dark conditions . To confirm that the transcriptional defects in the rpaA deletion mutant affect carbon catabolism , we measured the enzymatic activities of glycogen phosphorylase ( glgP ) , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( zwf ) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( gnd ) in the dark , and observed that activity of each enzyme was strongly reduced in the rpaA- strain compared to wild type ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , the rpaA- strain appears to be unable to activate the carbon catabolic pathways upon the onset of darkness because it cannot induce transcription of the requisite enzymes at dusk . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 23210 . 009Figure 3 .

In wild type cyanobacteria glycogen accumulates during the afternoon ( Cerven\u00fd and Nedbal , 2009; Knoop et al . , 2010; R\u00fcgen et al . , 2015 ) through the activity of a glycogen synthesis pathway composed of phosphoglucomutase ( pgm1 and pgm2 ) , ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ( glgC ) and glycogen synthase ( glgA ) ( Figure 4A ) . To analyze whether the dawn-arrested rpaA- strain can accumulate glycogen reserves , we measured expression and activity of the glycogen synthesis enzymes and found that neither the expression levels nor activity of the enzymes in the pathway were significantly reduced in the rpaA- strain ( Figure 4B and C ) . Surprisingly , we observed that while glycogen content oscillates over a period of 24 hr in wild type cells both in constant light and in light\/dark cycles , glycogen is present at a very low level in the rpaA- strain regardless of light conditions , despite high levels of the synthetic enzymes in the extracts ( Figure 4D ) . The same glycogen accumulation defect occurs in the rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain , demonstrating that it is a direct effect of deletion of rpaA ( Figure 4E ) . Like the rpaA- strain , glycogen synthesis mutants ( glgA- and glgC- ) exhibit reduced viability in alternating light\/dark conditions ( Gr\u00fcndel et al . , 2012 ) , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A , bottom panel ) and in constant darkness ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , but grow somewhat slower than the rpaA- strain in constant light conditions ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A , top panel ) . We conclude that the deficiency in the preparation of a reserve carbon source \u2013 which occurs not at the level of transcription of the glycogen synthesis genes or regulation of the activity of the encoded enzymes \u2013 may contribute to the impaired viability of the rpaA- strain in the dark . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 23210 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 23210 . 013 We hypothesized that the inability of the rpaA- strain to maintain appropriate energy levels and cell viability in the dark stems from the defects in accumulation of carbon\/energy stores during the day and their utilization at night . To assess whether restoration of the correct carbon catabolic route in darkness is sufficient to rescue the energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light\/dark conditions , we reconstituted the activities of the carbon utilization pathways and provided a transporter for uptake of external carbon . We restored expression of the carbon utilization enzymes in the rpaA- strain by placing their expression under an IPTG-inducible ectopic Ptrc promoter , and confirmed that induction with IPTG restored enzyme activity in cell extracts ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To counterbalance the inability of the rpaA- cells to accumulate internal carbon reserves , we expressed the GalP transporter to allow glucose uptake from the medium . Expression of either the missing enzymes or the GalP transporter alone with supplementation of glucose in the rpaA- background was not sufficient to restore viability of this strain ( Figure 5A and B ) . However , restoration of the carbon utilization pathways combined with the introduction of the glucose transporter in the presence of glucose rescued the viability defect of the rpaA- strain ( Figure 5A and B ) . Glucose feeding does not increase accumulation of internal carbon stores in this engineered strain ( Figure 5C ) , nor in wild type expressing the\u00a0GalP transporter ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . However , it is sufficient to restore high energy charge in the rpaA- strain expressing both the key catabolic enzymes and GalP ( Figure 5D ) . Our results strongly suggest that functional circadian output mediated by the activity of RpaA is required for the anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day , as well as metabolic switching to carbon catabolism at dusk . These metabolic adaptations allow cells to stimulate energy production and sustain cell viability during periods of darkness that challenge and constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 23210 . 014Figure 5 .

The circadian clock schedules periods of activity of RpaA to coordinate anticipatory carbon reserve formation during the day with carbon utilizing metabolic pathways activated at dusk to fuel cell integrity and viability in an environment in which light and dark periods alternate . Defects present in the rpaA deficient cells , indicated by red symbols on the diagram , lead to a low energy charge and reduced viability during periods of darkness .

To maximize fitness , photosynthetic organisms need to accurately allocate resources by carrying out carbon assimilation during the day and utilizing stored carbohydrate reserves at night ( Smith , 1983 ) . Here we show that the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor RpaA , regulated by the circadian clock , is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light\/dark cycles . Deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk ( Figure 5E ) \u2013 this leads to alterations in cellular energy charge and , as previously observed , to a severe reduction in fitness . It is yet to be determined whether RpaA is rewiring carbon metabolism solely through transcriptional control or through other mechanisms . The mechanism underlying perturbed carbon accumulation in the rpaA- strain is unclear . The activities of glycogen synthesizing enzymes in the rpaA- strain are high in vitro , however they could be affected in vivo by the redox state of the cell or by metabolite levels . It is also possible that an RpaA-dependent transcript expressed in the afternoon is required to funnel assimilated carbon into glycogen synthesis . Alternatively , additional metabolic flux changes may occur in the rpaA- strain that prevent formation of glycogen stores . Finally , it is formally possible that the rpaA- cells perform a futile cycle , simultaneously synthesizing and breaking glycogen down . However , since the activity of the glycogen phosphorylase involved in glycogen degradation is low in the rpaA- strain , we find this scenario less likely . Our data support a model in which anticipation of periodic dark-induced resource limitation is one essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system . The output of the core oscillator , through regulation of RpaA activity , temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for the metabolic demands of periods of darkness . Correct scheduling of central carbon metabolic activities allows cells to survive the night . Recently , Lambert et al . observed that the circadian clock orchestrates a trade-off between rapid cell growth in the morning and robustness to starvation in the afternoon , suggesting preparation for the night as a plausible role for the circadian clock ( Lambert et al . , 2016 ) . Our findings are consistent with this model and provide novel mechanistic insight into circadian regulation of cyanobacterial energy metabolism . It remains to be investigated whether the circadian-driven preparation for darkness is a shared strategy employed by other photosynthetic organisms . Further , our results suggest a molecular explanation for the observed selective advantage of circadian resonance . When the periods of the endogenous circadian system and periods of the environmental fluctuations are equal , organisms show a fitness advantage and outcompete mutants whose clocks have an altered periodicity in the same environment ( Ouyang et al . , 1998; Woelfle et al . , 2004 ) . The mechanistic basis for this observation has been lacking . Based on our findings , we expect that the fitness defects in the strains with core oscillator periods unequal to the period of environmental variation result from mistiming of RpaA activation . The resultant mistiming of accumulation and mobilization of glycogen stores with the onset of the nightfall would lead to a carbon deficit at night , and impact growth as in the rpaA- mutant during dark periods . One role of the KaiABC clock in our model , therefore , is to correctly phase the activity of RpaA and downstream carbon metabolism with the external environment , maximizing fitness and growth . Though we show that RpaA activity is crucial for regulation of key aspects of carbohydrate metabolism , we identify\u00a0~90 genes whose expression is abrogated at dusk and throughout darkness in the rpaA- strain and it is possible that additional physiological processes are defective in the absence of rpaA . Moreover , although our results indicate that the KaiABC clock is the main regulator of diurnal RpaA phosphorylation , other factors may influence the activity of RpaA or its regulon under fluctuating environmental conditions . RpaA is known to cooperate with RpaB ( Espinosa et al . , 2015 ) , a transcription factor crucial for responses to high light conditions . CikA , the clock-controlled regulator of RpaA phosphorylation , has been proposed to directly sense redox state of the cell ( Ivleva et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , additional RpaA regulators , LabA and CikB , have been proposed ( Taniguchi et al . , 2010; Boyd et al . , 2016 ) . Hence , it is possible that in a rapidly changing environment RpaA integrates circadian cues with environmental inputs important for viability . It will be interesting to analyze how deletion of rpaA affects the ability of cells to respond to other environmental challenges that cyanobacteria routinely face . Finally , our data together with a recent study by Diamond and colleagues ( Diamond et al . , 2015 ) emphasize the role of the circadian output pathway in driving oscillations in metabolism . On the other hand , it has been demonstrated that metabolic processes provide feedback to the circadian clock by regulating its resetting , indicating an important role of the fluctuating metabolic status of a cell in driving circadian oscillations ( Rust et al . , 2011; Pattanayak et al . , 2014 , 2015 ) . Together , a complex bidirectional relationship between the circadian program and metabolism emerges in which the circadian system both controls and is controlled by the metabolic rhythms to set and tune cell physiology with the environmental cycles . This tight coupling between circadian machinery and metabolism is coming to light as a universal feature across kingdoms of life ( Green et al . , 2008; Dodd et al . , 2015 ) . \n Wild type Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 was acquired from ATCC ( RRID:SCR_001672 ) catalog no . 33912 . Strains were constructed using standard protocols for genomic integration by homologous recombination ( Clerico et al . , 2007 ) and are listed in Supplementary file 2 . All plasmids for strain construction were generated using Gibson assembly ( Gibson et al . , 2009 ) and verified by Sanger sequencing . All strains were analyzed using colony PCR to verify target integration into the genome . Strains with point mutations introduced in the kaiC or rpaA open reading frames were additionally verified by PCR amplifying and Sanger sequencing of the relevant gene . The rpaA- strain was constructed by transforming wild type cells with p\u0394rpaA ( Gmr ) that was a gift from Joe Markson . The \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain was constructed following Teng et al . ( 2013 ) by replacing the native PkaiBC promoter between base pairs 1240468 and 1240554 on S . elongatus chromosome with a P0050 promoter encompassing 508 base pairs upstream of the translation start of synpcc7942_0050 . We used a kanamycin resistance cassette upstream of the promoter as a selection marker . The rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain was made by transforming p\u0394rpaA ( Gmr ) plasmid into the \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain background . The rpaA- +rpaA strain was made by transforming wild type S . elongatus simultaneously with p\u0394rpaA ( Gmr ) and an NS1 targeting vector pAM1303 carrying the rpaA gene with its native promoter encompassing 400 base pairs upstream of the translation start . The pAM1303 plasmid was a gift from Susan Golden . The rpaA- + empty plasmid was created by transforming wild type cells with a p\u0394rpaA ( Gmr ) plasmid and an empty NS1 targeting vector pAM1303 . The cRpaA\u00a0\u2018clock rescue\u2019 and\u00a0cRpaA D53A\u00a0\u2018clock rescue\u2019 strains were both made using the \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain background . In these strains the rpaA promoter was changed to a P0050 promoter allowing for continuous expression of RpaA and RpaA D53A . A gentamycin resistance cassette was placed upstream of the P0050 promoter for selection . The D53A mutation was introduced following Markson et al . ( 2013 ) . The kaiBC- strain was constructed by transforming wild type cells with p\u0394kaiBC ( Cmr ) that was a gift from Joe Markson . To construct strains expressing phosphomimetic mutants of KaiC we transformed kaiBC- cells with an NS1 targeting vector pAM1303 carrying kaiBC S431E T432E , kaiBC S431A T432A or kaiBC expressed from the P0050 promoter allowing for constitutive expression of kaiBC variants . Because RpaA regulates its own expression , we replaced the rpaA promoter with the P0050 promoter free of circadian feedback , ensuring equal and unperturbed expression of RpaA in the KaiC phosphomimetic mutants . The strain lacking the glgP_gap1 ( synpcc7942_0244\u20130245 ) operon was made using the pBR322 plasmid carrying the kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by 1000 nucleotides of DNA from upstream and downstream of glgP_gap1 locus . In the zwf-fbp-opcA- strain the zwf_fbp_opcA operon ( synpcc7942_2333\u20132335 ) was replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette . In the gnd- strain the gnd gene ( synpcc7942_0039 ) was replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette . The strain lacking glgA ( synpcc7942_2518 ) and the strain lacking glgC ( synpcc7942_0603 ) were made by using the pBR322 plasmids carrying the kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by 1000 nucleotides of DNA from upstream and downstream of respectively glgA and glgC locus . The wild type +galP strain was made by transforming wild type cells with Ptrc::galP construct in a modified NS1 targeting vector pAM1303 in which the cassette providing resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin was replaced with a nourseothricin resistance cassette ( Taton et al . , 2014 ) . The gene galP was amplified from the E . coli genomic DNA . The wild type +enzymes strain was made by sequentially replacing Pgnd , Pglg_gap1\u00a0and Pzwf_fbp_opcA with the Ptrc promoter making expression of gnd , glgP_gap1\u00a0and zwf_fbp_opcA transcripts IPTG-inducible . The wild type +enzymes +galP strain was made by transforming the wild type +enzymes strain with Ptrc::galP construct in a modified NS1\u00a0targeting vector pAM1303 that carried a nourseothricin resistance cassette . The rpaA- +galP , rpaA- +enzymes and rpaA- +enzymes +galP strains were made by transforming p\u0394rpaA ( Gmr ) plasmid respectively into wild type +galP , wild type +enzymes and wild type +enzymes +galP strains . Cell cultures of wild type and mutant cells were grown under illumination with cool fluorescent light at 40 \u03bcE m\u22122 s\u22121 ( \u03bcmoles photons m\u22122 s\u22121 ) in BG11 medium at 30\u00b0C . For the light\/dark experiments , cultures were incubated under alternating 12 hr light\/12 hr dark conditions with the same light intensity of 40 \u03bcE m\u22122 s\u22121\u00a0during light periods . For the experiment performed in Figure 1C cells were grown in the presence or in the absence of 20 \u03bcM IPTG . For the experiments performed in Figure 5 strains were grown in BG-11 medium with 100 \u03bcM IPTG with or without supplementation with 0 . 4% ( w\/v ) glucose . For the experiments described in Figure 2 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 , Figure 3 , Figure 4 , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 wild type or \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strains were entrained by exposure to 12 hr of darkness , followed by 12 hr of light , followed by another 12 hr of darkness . The rpaA- or rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strains in these experiments were entrained by one pulse of 12 hr of darkness , followed by incubation in light to allow cell growth to resume . For the experiments described in Figure 1E , Figure 1G , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 cells were entrained by two pulses of 12 hr of darkness . For the experiments described in Figure 5C and D the strains were entrained by one pulse of 12 hr of darkness and then incubated in light until the start of the experiment . For the liquid growth assays , liquid cultures of wild type and mutant cells were pre-grown in continuous light in a medium lacking antibiotics . Cultures were diluted to OD750 = 0 . 02 and grown either in constant light or in 12 hr light\/ 12 hr dark cycling conditions at 30\u00b0C . Optical density of cells was monitored at 750 nm . Experiments were performed in duplicate ( Figure 1C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A , Figure 5A and B ) or in triplicate ( Figure 1A and B ) . For the spot plate growth assays , liquid cultures of wild type and mutant cells were pre-grown in continuous light in a medium lacking antibiotics . Cells were diluted to OD750 = 0 . 25 and a dilution series was performed from 100 to 10\u22124 . Then , 10 \u03bcl of each dilution step were spotted onto BG11 agar plates with no antibiotics . Plates were incubated in constant light at 30\u00b0C for 7 days or under 12 hr light\/ 12 hr dark alternating conditions for 14 days . Viability after prolonged dark treatment was assessed by a colony forming unit assay . Light-grown cultures were diluted to OD750\u00a0=\u00a00 . 025 , transferred to darkness and sampled every 24 hr . Each aliquot removed from the culture was diluted in BG11 medium 1000 fold by serial dilution . 100 \u03bcl of the diluted culture were plated onto a BG11 plate . Plates were incubated for 7 days at 30\u00b0C under constant illumination and colonies on each plate were counted . Viability was expressed as: % viability = N\/N0 \u00d7 100% , where N0 is the colony count before exposure of cultures to darkness . Each experiment was performed in duplicate . Cells were harvested for western blotting by filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen . To prepare protein samples , cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer ( 8 M urea , 20 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 and 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol ) and ruptured by bead-beating with 0 . 1 mm glass beads for total of 5 min with periodic cooling on ice . Cell lysates were centrifuged for 12 min at 20 , 000 g at 4\u00b0C . Protein concentration of each sample was determined by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) . For experiment performed in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 lysates were loaded on 4\u201320% Tris-Glycine Gel ( Novex ) . Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus ( Bio-Rad ) . The membrane was blocked in TBST\u00a0+2 . 5% milk and then incubated with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against RpaA or against KaiC ( Cocalico Biologicals ) . To quantify phosphorylated RpaA in experiments presented in Figure 1E and Figure 1G , we performed Phos-tag western blots as described in Markson et al . ( 2013 ) . Quantification of western blots was performed using ImageJ software ( RRID:SCR_003070 ) . Nucleotides were extracted following the method used by Rust et al . ( 2011 ) with modifications . 2 ml of the cyanobacterial culture were added to 0 . 5 ml of ice-cold 3 M perchloric acid with 77 mM EDTA , vortexed briefly and incubated on ice for 5 min . The mixture was neutralized with 1 . 34 ml of 1 M KOH , 0 . 5 M Tris , 0 . 5 M KCl and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C . The supernatant was then filtered through Amicon Ultra-4 filters ( Millipore ) and stored at \u201380\u00b0C . To measure adenine nucleotides , extracts were thawed and diluted 2 . 6X . For ATP measurement , extracts were diluted in a buffer containing 25 mM KCl , 50 mM MgSO4 and 100 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ( L buffer ) with 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate . To measure ADP + ATP , extracts were diluted in the above buffer containing also 3 U ml\u22121 type II pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . To measure AMP + ADP + ATP , extracts were diluted in the L buffer containing 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate , 3 U ml\u22121 type II pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle and 75 U ml\u22121 myokinase from rabbit muscle ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Diluted extracts were incubated for 30 min in a 37\u00b0C water bath followed by 10 min of heat treatment at 90\u00b0C to inactivate enzymes . Extracts were assayed in triplicate in a black 96-well plate . 30 \u03bcl of the L buffer containing 35 \u03bcg ml\u22121 firefly luciferase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and 1 mM luciferin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added to 260 \u03bcl of the extract . The luminescence signal was measured from each well in a TopCount luminescence counter ( Perkin-Elmer ) . For the RNA-sequencing experiment the \u2018clock rescue\u2019 and the rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strains were entrained and harvested by filtering and freezing in liquid-nitrogen at following time points: dusk ( ZT\u00a0=\u00a012 hr ) ; 5 min , 15 min , 30 min , 1 hr , 2 hr , 4 hr , 8 hr and 11 hr 50 min after exposure to darkness; and 5 min , 15 min and 30 min after re-exposure to light at dawn . RNA purification and library preparation were performed as described in Markson et al . ( 2013 ) . NCBI reference sequences NC_007604 . 1 , NC_004073 . 2 , and NC_004990 . 1 were used to align sequencing reads to the S . elongatus chromosome and the endogenous plasmids with Bowtie ( RRID:SCR_005476 ) . Uniquely mappable reads with maximum of three mismatches per read were allowed to map to the genome . To quantify gene expression we counted the number of coding reads between the start and stop positions of open reading frames . We performed RPKM normalization and searched for differentially expressed genes that are at least 3-fold lower in the rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain than in the control in at least 5 of the 12 measured time points . We performed an analysis of the functional annotations of the protein coding genes whose expression is defective in the rpaA- \u2018clock rescue\u2019 strain using gene functions available in the Cyanobase ( RRID:SCR_007615 ) . The sequencing data reported in this article can be found in the NCBI GEO DataSets ( RRID:SCR_005012 ) under the accession number: GSE89999 . Following entrainment ( two cycles of entrainment for wild type and the kaiBC- strain and one cycle for the rpaA- strain ) equal ODs of wild type , the kaiBC- and the rpaA- cells were harvested by filtering and freezing in liquid nitrogen . For the experiment described in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 cells were harvested at dusk ( ZT = 12 hr ) and 5 min , 15 min , 30 min , 1 hr and 2 hr following exposure to darkness . For the experiment described in Figure 4B cells were harvested in the morning ( ZT = 3 hr ) and in the afternoon ( ZT = 9 hr ) . RNA extraction was performed as above .

To prepare lysates cells were resuspended in an appropriate assay buffer as described below with Complete EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitors ( Roche ) , transferred to 2 ml screw-cap tubes containing 0 . 1 mm glass beads ( Research Products International Corp ) and lysed by ten 30 s long cycles of bead-beating at 4\u00b0C with periodic cooling on ice . Protein concentration of each sample was determined by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) . Assays were performed in 96-well plate in the reaction volume of 200 \u03bcl . Glycogen phosphorylase activity was assayed in a buffer containing 18 mM KH2PO4 , 27 mM Na2HPO4 , 15 mM MgCl2 and 100 \u03bcM EDTA with 340 \u03bcM Na2NADP+ , 4 \u03bcM glucose-1 , 6-bisphosphate ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 0 . 8 U ml\u22121phosphoglucomutase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 6 U ml\u22121 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and 2 mg ml\u22121 glycogen from bovine liver ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as substrate ( Fu and Xu , 2006 ) . Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed in 10 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris maleate , pH 7 . 5 with 2 mM NADP+ and 4 mM glucose-6-phosphate ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as substrate ( Schaeffer and Stanier , 1978 ) . 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was assayed in 10 mM MgCl2\u00a0and 50 mM Tris maleate , pH 7 . 5 with 2 mM NADP+ and 2 mM 6-phosphogluconate ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as substrate ( Schaeffer and Stanier , 1978 ) .

Glycogen synthase was assayed in a three-step reaction following Suzuki et al . ( 2010 ) . First , ADP was generated from ADP-glucose in a reaction consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 20 mM DTT , 2 mM ADP-glucose ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 2 mg ml\u22121 oyster glycogen ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as substrate and the cell extract . The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 30\u00b0C and then stopped by heat treatment at 100\u00b0C for 2 min . Then , ATP was generated from ADP by mixing the solution 3:1 with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM phosphocreatine ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 200 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , and 0 . 5 mg ml\u22121 creatine phosphokinase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , and incubated for 30 min at 30\u00b0C . The reaction was stopped by heat treatment in a 100\u00b0C metal block for 2 min . Finally , the amount of ATP was measured by mixing the solution 3:2 with a buffer comprising of 125 mM HEPES-NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM glucose , 20 mM MgCl2 , and 1 mM NADP+ and 5 U ml\u22121 each of hexokinase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase .

{"lay_summary":"Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids . Groups of amino acids within the protein can then fold into three-dimensional shapes , one of the most common being a helical structure known as an \u03b1-helix . Two or more \u03b1-helices may be wound around each other to form a bundle called a coiled coil , which is found in many proteins . Each complete turn of an \u03b1-helix contains a set number of amino acids , but the number of amino acids in the turns of a coiled coil can vary . The most common pattern in a coiled coil has 7 amino acids over two turns , which is known as a heptad repeat . When amino acids are added into or deleted from the heptad repeats , the number of amino acids in the turns of a coiled coil changes . However , it cannot increase too far beyond the number of amino acids in each turn of a normal \u03b1-helix because there is a limit to the amount of coiling that the helices can tolerate . Many naturally occurring coiled coils have regions where the overall \u03b1-helical structure is retained , even though there are small sections where the number of amino acids in a turn is disrupted . This may be due to insertions of small numbers of amino acids . Although the impact of some insertions ( e . g . three or four at a time ) has been studied , the effect of inserting other amounts of amino acids was not clear . Hartmann et al . investigated what would happen when two or six amino acids were inserted into the heptad repeats of a coiled coil within a protein from bacteria . These numbers of amino acids have been predicted to cause the greatest strain on the coiled coil structure . The experiments show that inserting these numbers of amino acids caused so much strain that the three \u03b1-helices making up the coiled coil break apart and refold into a completely different type of structure called a \u03b2-strand . The three short \u03b2-strands then associate into a triangular structure that Hartmann et al . named a \u03b2-layer . Further experiments showed that inserting the same numbers of amino acids into the heptad repeats of other coiled coil proteins also resulted in the formation of \u03b2-layers . Hartmann et al . \u2019s findings suggest that the alternating \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-strand structures may help to make the proteins stronger and enable to carry out more versatile roles in cells .","article":"Coiled coils are the best-understood protein fold , as their backbone structure can uniquely be described by parametric equations . This level of understanding has allowed their manipulation in unprecedented detail . They do not seem a likely source of surprises , yet we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel , trimeric coiled coil . These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point , causing the local formation of short \u03b2-strands , which move the path of the chain by 120\u00b0 around the trimer axis . The result is an \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil , which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil . Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold . \n \u03b1-Helical coiled coils are ubiquitous protein domains , found in a wide range of structural and functional contexts ( Lupas , 1996 ) . They were the first protein fold described in atomic detail ( Crick , 1953b ) and are also the only one whose backbone structure can be computed with parametric equations ( Crick , 1953a ) , placing them at the forefront of protein design efforts ( Huang et al . , 2014; Joh et al . , 2014; Thomson et al . , 2014; Woolfson , 2005 ) . The structure of coiled coils is understood at a level unrivaled by any other fold . They consist of at least two \u03b1-helices , wound into superhelical bundles and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core . In their most prevalent form they follow a heptad sequence repeat pattern . The seven positions in a heptad are labeled a \u2013 g , where positions a and d are oriented towards the core of the bundle and are thus mostly hydrophobic . Beyond the heptad repeat , a range of other periodicities is accessible to coiled coils , which is only restrained by the periodicity of the unperturbed \u03b1-helix ( Gruber and Lupas , 2003 ) . This restraint is responsible for the supercoiling of the bundle: As an ideal , straight \u03b1-helix has a periodicity of about 3 . 63 residues per turn , the heptad coiled coil has a left-handed twist to reduce the periodicity to 3 . 5 residues per turn with respect to the bundle axis . In hendecad coiled coils , the situation is reversed: 11 residues are accommodated in 3 helical turns , resulting in 11\/3 = 3 . 67 residues per turn . As this is slightly above 3 . 63 , hendecads are slightly right-handed . With the periodicity of pentadecad coiled coils , 15\/4 = 3 . 75 residues per turn , right-handedness is as pronounced as left-handedness is in heptad coiled coils . Many naturally occurring coiled coils contain transitions between segments of different periodicity ( Alvarez et al . , 2010; Hartmann et al . , 2014 ) or harbor discontinuities that retain the \u03b1-helical structure , but perturb the periodicity locally ( Parry , 2014 ) . The best understood discontinuities are insertions of 3 or 4 residues , which are close to the periodicity of 3 . 63 of \u03b1-helices ( Brown et al . , 1996; Hicks et al . , 2002; Lupas and Gruber , 2005 ) . The insertion of 3 residues is termed a stammer , the insertion of 4 residues a stutter . With 3 residues being less than one full turn of a helix , stammers lead to a local decrease in periodicity and an increase of left-handedness . Stutters have the opposite effect . Inserted into a heptad coiled coil , a stutter can locally extend one heptad to form a hendecad ( 7 + 4 = 11 -> 11\/3 ) or , being delocalized over multiple heptads , lead to even higher periodicities like 18 residues over 5 turns ( 7 + 7 + 4 = 18 -> 18\/5 ) . Other periodicities can be brought about by the insertion of multiple stammers or stutters ( e . g . 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 -> 15\/4 ) . These relationships are illustrated in Figure 1 , which shows the effects on coiled-coil periodicity resulting from consecutive insertions of stammers ( blue lines ) and stutters ( green lines ) , and from their progressive delocalization ( red lines ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 003Figure 1 . Transitions in periodicity caused by insertions of one to six residues into the heptad repeat . The green area marks the estimated boundaries of periodicities accessible to \u03b1-helical coiled coils . It is centered around the periodicity of unperturbed \u03b1-helices , about 3 . 63 residues per turn . Higher values than 3 . 63 lead to right-handed and lower values to left-handed supercoiling . The effects of consecutive insertions of stammers ( 3 residues ) or stutters ( 4 residues ) into a heptad pattern are shown by blue and green lines , respectively . The red lines correspond to the insertion of 1 to 6 residues into the heptad periodicity and their progressive delocalization over neighboring heptads . For example , an insertion of 4 residues is accommodated as 11 residues over 3 turns ( 11\/3 ) , when delocalized over one heptad , or as 18\/5 , when delocalized over two . Insertions of 1 or 5 residues have to be delocalized over two heptads , resulting in periodicities of 15\/4 or 19\/5 ( which could also be brought about by consecutive stutters \u2013 following the green line from 7\/2 over 11\/3 over 15\/4 to 19\/5 ) . Insertions of 3 can be accommodated as 10\/3 , at the very edge of the green area , although in the known examples the \u03b1-helices are distorted due to the strong left-handed supercoiling which could be avoided by further delocalization . For insertions of 2 or 6 residues ( dashed lines ) a strong delocalization would be required to reach the green lawn of accessible periodicities . However , for all constructs in this paper , this is not observed . Via the formation of \u03b2-layers these insertions sustain the heptad periodicity as unperturbed as possible . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 003 However , there are limits to the periodicities coiled coils can assume , imposed by the degree of supercoiling the constituent helices can tolerate . The insertion of a stammer into a heptad coiled coil , leading locally to a periodicity of 10\/3 = 3 . 33 , was predicted to cause an overwinding of the helices ( Brown et al . , 1996 ) . We could verify this experimentally: the structure of a stammer showed that the local overwinding introduced sufficient strain to cause the formation of a short 310-helical segment ( Hartmann et al . , 2009 ) . We therefore assume that 3 . 33 ( 10\/3 ) residues per turn mark the lower limit for periodicities . As this is about 0 . 3 residues per turn less than the periodicity of a perfectly straight helix , one might expect the upper limit at a periodicity of about 3 . 9 . In fact the vast majority of known coiled-coil structures deviating from the heptad repeat have periodicities higher than 3 . 5 and the most extreme example is found in the trimeric autotransporter YadA , which has a local periodicity of 3 . 8 ( 19\/5 ) ( Alvarez et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast to stammers and stutters , accommodating insertions of 1 or 5 residues is more demanding for the bundle . According to Figure 1 they have to be delocalized over more than one heptad , as periodicities of 4 . 0 ( ( 7+1 ) \/2 ) or 2 . 66 ( ( 7+1 ) \/3 ) do not fall into the accessible range , and neither do 2 . 5 ( 0+5\/2 ) , 4 . 0 ( ( 7+5 ) \/3 ) or 3 . 0 ( ( 7+5 ) \/4 ) . To retain \u03b1-helical structure , both insertions of 1 and 5 residues have to be delocalized over at least two heptads , leading to periodicities of 3 . 75 ( 15\/4 ) and 3 . 8 ( 19\/5 ) , respectively . Interestingly , these periodicities can also be brought about by the insertion of 2 ( 15\/4 ) and 3 ( 19\/5 ) consecutive stutters . Alternatively , insertions of 1 residue ( skip residues ) can be accommodated by the local formation of a \u03c0-turn in the \u03b1-helix , leaving the remaining coiled coil largely unperturbed ( Lupas , 1996 ) . Still missing for a complete picture of coiled-coil periodicities is the understanding of insertions of 2 and 6 residues , which should cause the greatest strain on \u03b1-helical geometry . We find that they indeed break the \u03b1-helices to form short \u03b2-strands , which associate into a triangular supersecondary structure we name the \u03b2-layer . \u03b2-Layers are found , also repetitively , in natural coiled coils , where they form regular fibers with alternating \u03b1- and \u03b2-structure , a protein fold that has not been described so far . \n We have a long-standing interest in trimeric autotransporter adhesins ( TAA ) , fibrous proteins of the Gram-negative bacterial surface ( Bassler et al . , 2015; Hartmann et al . , 2012; Hoiczyk et al . , 2000; Szczesny and Lupas , 2008 ) , whose domains we routinely fuse to stabilizing adaptor coiled coils for biochemical and biophysical study ( Deiss et al . , 2014; Hernandez Alvarez et al . , 2008 ) . In the process , we have repeatedly gained insights into aspects of coiled-coil structure ( Alvarez et al . , 2010; Grin et al . , 2014; Hartmann et al . , 2012; 2009; Leo et al . , 2011 ) , such as for example into a recurrent polar motif of the hydrophobic core ( the N@d layer ) , in which asparagines in position d of the core coordinate anions at their center ( Hartmann et al . , 2009 ) . As part of that study , we identified a putative TAA in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , OMP100 , which carries insertions of 2 and of 3 residues within the heptad repeats of its stalk . The insertion of 2 residues extends a heptad to the 9-residue motif IENKADKAD and occurs between three N-terminal and two C-terminal heptads carrying N@d layers; the insertion of 3 residues is directly downstream . This observation was highly puzzling , since the heptad register of the protein could be assigned with great confidence , leaving no doubt that an insertion of 2 residues had occurred , but this insertion could not be explained by coiled-coil theory . For structural characterization , we therefore expressed residues 133Q-198K , covering the two insertions and the five N@d layers , fused N- and C-terminally to the trimeric form of the GCN4 leucine zipper , GCN4-pII ( Table 1 ) . The construct yielded a typical \u03b1-helical CD spectrum and , upon heating , unfolded cooperatively with a transition midpoint at 91\u00b0C . We obtained crystals in space group C2 that diffracted to a resolution of 2 . 3\u2009\u00c5 , with one symmetric trimer in the asymmetric unit . The structure showed a continuous heptad coiled coil with two discontinuities ( Figure 2 ) . As expected , the insertion of 3 residues C-terminal to the N@d layers led to the formation of a decad , with a short 310-helical segment , as for the stammer we had described previously ( Hartmann et al . , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 004Table 1 .

The area of the stammer is highlighted in pink , the three residues of the \u03b2-layer by a grey bar .

The plot is smoothed over a window of three residues to mask local fluctuations . Empty regions of the Ramachandran plot are cropped . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 005 However , the insertion of 2 residues led to a sharp break in the coiled coil: In the middle of the IENKADKAD motif , the three chains of the trimer cross each other to form a triangular plane perpendicular to the coiled-coil axis . Thereby only the central three residues of the motif , KAD , deviate from \u03b1-helical structure ( Figure 2 ) . All three fall into the \u03b2 region of the Ramachandran plot , but only the central residue , alanine , forms backbone hydrogen bonds with the alanine residues of the other chains . We call this structural element a \u03b2-layer . It is essentially the same \u03b2-layer we described as an adaptor between \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-stranded segments of TAAs ( Hartmann et al . , 2012 ) . Here it directly connects two \u03b1-helical segments , where the C-terminal one is rotated counterclockwise by ~120\u00b0 around the trimer axis , as viewed from the N-terminus ( Figure 2 ) . The first three residues of the IENKADKAD sequence motif occupy heptad positions a , b and c of the N-terminal \u03b1-helical segment , the last three residues positions e , f and g of the C-terminal segment . Therefore the \u03b2-layer , formed by the three central residues KAD , occurs in place of position d . The two segments are stabilized in their relative orientation by backbone hydrogen bonds from the last ( c position ) residue of each N-terminal helix to the first ( e position ) residue in the C-terminal helix of the neighboring chain ( Figure 2C ) . This extends the continuous backbone hydrogen-bond network of each \u03b1-helix across the chains . The nature of the discontinuity represented by this \u03b2-layer is related to the nature of stammers , but its effects are much stronger . With the insertion of 3 residues , stammers constitute a major strain on the conformation of the constituent helices of the coiled coil . In all examples to date , the resulting overwinding of the helices is absorbed by a short 310-helical segment . While these stammers can be best described to be part of a decad , the \u03b2-layer in OMP100 occurs in a motif of nine residues , a nonad . As the requirements of a nonad on its helices would be even more extreme than those of a decad , the strategy for its accommodation is a local but complete departure from helical structure . Given the structural simplicity of \u03b2-layers , we wondered whether these could be brought about more generally by insertions of 2 residues into heptad coiled coils . Furthermore we wondered whether insertions of 6 residues , which pose similar demands on the coiled coil ( Figure 1 ) , also lead to the formation of \u03b2-layers . To tackle these questions experimentally , we designed a set of constructs that had either 6 or 9 residues inserted between two consecutive GCN4 N16V adaptors , based on two different sequence motifs ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) . One motif is IENKADKAD from Actinobacillus OMP100 . The other , MATKDDIAN , is from a second family of prokaryotic coiled-coil proteins that we found to contain nonads and related periodicities; it occurs for example in 14 consecutive repeats in the protein Tcar0761 of Thermosinus carboxydivorans . From Actinobacillus OMP100 we derived the constructs A9 with the full IENKADKAD motif and A6 with the shortened motif IENKAD , as well as the \u2018control\u2019 construct A7 with the 7-residue motif IENKKAD . From Thermosinus Tcar0761 we derived the constructs T9 , with the full MATKDDIAN motif , and T6 , with the shortened motif MATKDD . The GCN4 N16V variant can form both dimeric and trimeric coiled coils and was chosen for these constructs to test for the oligomerization specificity of the inserts . All five constructs were resistant to proteolysis by proteinase K , showed typical \u03b1-helical CD spectra , did not melt upon heating to 95\u00b0C and yielded well-diffracting crystals . The structures of all constructs were trimeric and could be solved by molecular replacement , using the trimeric GCN4 structure as a search model . For T9 , two structures were solved in alternative conformations ( Figure 3 ) . Apart from A7 , which carries a heptad insert , all structures formed \u03b2-layers . These are identical in their structure ( Figure 4 ) , although they are not accommodated in the same way . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 006Figure 3 . \u03b2-layers in 6- and 9-residue motifs between GCN4 adaptors . ( A ) The sequences and structures of the GCN4-fusion constructs are shown together with ( B ) a Ramachandran plot of their backbone torsion angles and ( C , D ) their periodicities . In the structures , the inserts between the GCN4 adaptors are drawn with thick lines . Disturbances in the \u03b1-helical segments are highlighted in pink; the stutter in the A6 structure and the stammer in the T96 structure are also highlighted in pink in panels C and D . In the periodicity plots , all proteins are aligned on the \u03b2-layer and their coiled-coil registers are indicated . The plots are shown separately for \u03b2-layers forming nonads ( C ) and hexads ( D ) . A glitch in the periodicity caused by the g\/c position preceding \u03b2-layers in hexads is highlighted in pink in panel D . As in the previous figure , the periodicity plots are smoothed over a three-residue sliding window . The Ramachandran plot in panel B includes all structures except the kinked grey A9b structure; all residues of the \u03b2-layers are shown as red dots and all other residues as black dots . Again , empty regions of the Ramachandran plot are cropped . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 00610 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 007Figure 4 . Superimposition of \u03b2-layers .

Superimpositions are shown separately for \u03b2-layers occurring ( A ) in nonads ( T99 , A9 , A9b , A6 ) and ( B ) in hexads ( T6 , T96 ) ; the kinked A9b structure ( grey in Figure 3 ) is omitted . Panel ( C ) shows all \u03b2-layers together . ( D ) Stereo view of the \u03b2-layer region in panel C , seen from the N-terminus . The structures are colored as in Figure 3 . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 007 In A9 and in one of the T9 structures , T99 , the \u03b2-layers are formed as in Actinobacillus OMP100 . The first three and last three residues of the insert are in heptad register with the flanking GCN4 adaptors and therefore constitute positions a , b , c and e , f , g . The middle three residues , KAD in A9 , KDD in T99 , form the \u03b2-layer in place of position d ( Figure 3C ) . The A6 structure follows the same principle: again the first three residues of the insert are in heptad register with the N-terminal GCN4-adaptor , constituting positions a , b and c . The other three residues of the insert , KAD , form the \u03b2-layer in place of position d . As a consequence , the register of the C-terminal GCN4-adaptor is shifted at the junction to the insert , starting with position e instead of position a . This register conflict is resolved further downstream by the formation of a hendecad ( highlighted in pink in Figure 3A and C ) , so that the second half of the C-terminal adaptor retains its original register . In essence , the A6 structure shows a 9-residue element with the same structure as those found in A9 and T99 , where the sequence IENKADMKQ borrows the last three residues from the C-terminal CGN4 adaptor and changes the periodicity of the latter at the junction . In contrast , the T6 structure shows a \u2018real\u2019 6-residue element . Here , the \u03b2-layer is formed by the first three residues of the insert , MAT ( Figure 3D ) . The last three residues of the insert assume geometrically clear e , f and g positions and the C-terminal GCN4 adaptor follows in its native register , starting with an a position . Therefore , the \u03b2-layer occurs again in place of position d . A conflict with the native register of the N-terminal adaptor is avoided with just a small \u2018twist\u2019 to the adaptor\u2019s last residue: The C-terminal leucine , natively occurring in position g , is rotated outward from the core of the bundle by about 15\u00b0 so that its Crick angle is biased towards the angle of a c position . In Figure 3 this is noted as a g\/c position , as it is close enough to an ideal position g for the preceding coiled coil to stay in register and close enough to a position c for the formation of the subsequent \u03b2-layer ( highlighted in pink in Figure 3D ) . Surprisingly , the alternative T9 structure , T96 , starts out in the same way , forming the \u03b2-layer with the first three residues of the insert , MAT , after a g\/c position . Consequently , the middle three residues constitute positions e , f and g . It thereby shows the same 6-residue element as the structure T6 . The last three residues of the insert are accommodated as a sharply localized stammer , before the C-terminal adaptor starts in position a ( highlighted in pink in Figure 3A and D ) . Thus , the two structures T6 and T96 show that 6-residue elements are accommodated as N-terminally shortened 9-residue elements . While \u03b2-layers seem to strictly dictate the downstream register to start with an e position , they can occur after both c and g positions . The observation that the T9 construct could accommodate the MATKDDIAN insert in two ways , forming the \u03b2-layer either at MAT or at KDD , led us to wonder whether the same could happen with the A9 insert , IENKADKAD , if the glutamate was interchanged with the central alanine to mirror the first six residues of the T9 insert ( A9b , IANKEDKAD ) . We had previously found that \u03b2-layers which occur as connectors between TAA domains prefer small , hydrophobic residues in their central position ( Hartmann et al . , 2012; Bassler et al . , 2015 ) . We therefore thought that the central aspartate of the T9 insert might have been sufficiently unfavorable ( T99 ) that an alternative , with the alanine of MAT at the center of the \u03b2-layer ( T96 ) , became observable , even though T99 allows the flanking coiled-coil segments to remain unperturbed and T96 requires their distortion . We reasoned that the larger glutamate residue at the center of A9b might even be sufficiently unfavorable to move this construct quantitatively to the alternative structure , with the \u03b2-layer formed over the first three residues ( IAN ) . A9b in fact crystallized in two alternative structures ( Figure 3 ) , but in both the \u03b2-layer formed over the central glutamate . Since this residue was indeed too large and polar to be accommodated without distortion , the first turns of the downstream helices are perturbed to different extents in both instances , leading to a pronounced kink in one of the structures ( highlighted in pink in Figure 3A ) . We were surprised to see that the penalty introduced by the central glutamate was not sufficient to produce the alternative structure; the reasons for this are unclear to us at present . With the expectation to obtain a continuous fiber of alternating \u03b1 and \u03b2 elements , we built a construct with repeating nonads , based on Thermosinus Tcar0761 ( Figure 5 ) . The 14 consecutive , almost perfect MATKDDIAN repeats in this protein are flanked by long heptad segments . In our construct we omitted the middle ten nonad\u00a0repeats and trimmed the N- and C terminal heptad segments for in-register fusion to GCN4-N16V ( Table 1; red sequence in Figure 5 ) . Crystallization trials yielded crystals in space group P63 , diffracting to a resolution of 1 . 6\u00c5 , with one chain in the asymmetric unit and the trimer built by crystallographic symmetry around the c axis . The structure could be solved by molecular replacement using fragments of the T6 and A9 structures . It shows the anticipated \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil with four consecutive \u03b2-layers . These layers are formed by the residues MAT of the repeats; the other residues , corresponding to KDDIAN , constitute positions e , f , g , a , b , c of the segments between the \u03b2-layers . Therefore , in accordance with heptad notation , the repeats can be written as IANMATKDD , with the isoleucine forming classical hydrophobic a layers and the MAT forming \u03b2-layers in place of position d ( Figure 5 ) . Only the first \u03b2-layer is part of a 6-residue element ( hexad ) and occurs after a position g of the preceding heptad . This g position is biased towards a c position , as described above for the structures T6 and T96 , yielding the same g\/c position . With its alternating a- and \u03b2-layers , the \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber , based on a novel supersecondary structure element . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 008Figure 5 . The \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil in the Tcar0761 construct . The two regions fused between GCN4 adaptors in our construct are shown in red on the full sequence of Tcar0761 ( left ) . Next to the sequence , the structure is depicted as a C\u03b1-trace and the four consecutive \u03b2-layers are enlarged . On the right , top views are shown , looking down the bundle from the N-terminus . As indicated by the arrows next to the side view , they show 1 , 2 , 3 or all 4 \u03b2-layers . At the bottom , the sequence of the construct is shown together with the assigned register . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 008 The \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil of Thermosinus Tcar0761 is built of nonads and thus contains six residues per repeat in the \u03b1 region of the Ramachandran plot , which retain one backbone hydrogen bond characteristic of \u03b1-helical structure . We think that it should be possible to reduce this structure by removing three \u03b1-helical residues and thus the single remaining backbone hydrogen bond from the parent structure . Such a minimalistic \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil would be built of hexads , with three residues in the \u03b2 and three in the \u03b1 region of the Ramachandran plot . We have not so far detected coiled-coil proteins with \u03b2-layers in hexad spacing , nor have we been successful in constructing such a structure by fusion of MATKDD repeats between GCN4-N16V adaptors . However , as we will show in the next section , a tail-fiber protein from a Streptococcus pyogenes prophage ( 2C3F ) contains an \u03b1\/\u03b2 coiled coil with four \u03b2-layers , two of which are in a hexad spacing . At the beginning of this project we had identified nonads in the stalks of TAAs and in the N-terminal coiled coils of a family of prokaryotic endonucleases listed in Pfam as PD- ( D\/E ) XK , specifically in the crenarchaeal representatives of this family . The bacterial representatives , where they had the coiled-coil stalk , lacked nonads or related periodicities ( in Pfam however , all the coiled-coil segments of this family are grouped together in entry DUF3782 ) . Surprisingly , we found that some bacteria contain coiled-coil proteins that lack the endonuclease domain , but are very similar to the coiled coils of the crenarchaeal proteins; Thermosinus Tcar0761 belongs to these . The \u03b2-layers in this family have the consensus sequence [aliphatic]\u2013A\u2013T\u2013K\u2013[polar]\u2013[DE] ( Figure 6 ) . Pattern searches with this motif led us to the discovery of a family of integral membrane proteins found in prokaryotes and mitochondria ( DUF1640 ) , which carry this motif prominently at the beginning of their C-terminal stalk ( Figure 6 ) . However , our sequence searches , both based on sequence patterns and on the discovery of relevant insertions into the heptads of coiled coils , have progressed slowly , as they require much case-by-case analysis . This is due on the one hand to the frequency of the \u03b2-layer sequence patterns in coiled coils and on the other to the difficulty of establishing reliably the local register of coiled coils that deviate from the heptad repeat with existing software . Indeed , as we have described for TAAs ( Szczesny and Lupas , 2008; Bassler et al . , 2015 ) , many of these escape detection entirely with current programs . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 009Figure 6 . Sequence logos for \u03b2-layers in different protein families . The sequence logos show the conservation patterns of \u03b2-layers and their adjacent secondary structure elements in domains of Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins ( stalk , neck , and two variants of the DALL domain ) , the DUF3782 family of prokaryotic endonucleases , the DUF1640 family of membrane proteins from prokaryotes and organelles , and the surface layer homology ( SLH ) domain of bacteria . Annotations of the secondary structure ( \u03b1: helix , \u03b2: strand ) and coiled-coil register are shown beneath the logos . Grey symbols on the sides indicate the type of secondary structure transition mediated by the \u03b2-layer . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 009 Given the structural identity between the \u03b2-layers resulting from hexads and nonads in coiled coils , and the supersecondary structures we characterized at the transition between coiled-coil segments and \u03b2-stranded domains in TAAs ( Hartmann et al . , 2012 ) , we searched systematically for other instances of \u03b2-layers in proteins of known structure . The results are collected in Figure 7 and Table 2 . All proteins we identified are homotrimers , except for the SLH domain , which is a monomer with pseudo-threefold symmetry; a majority are from viruses , mainly bacteriophage . Most \u03b2-layers occur in the context of coiled coils and we have termed these \u2018canonical\u2019 . They are usually found capping one of the ends of the coiled coil , more often the N-terminal than the C-terminal one , and we have found only two further examples of coiled coils with internal \u03b2-layers: MPN010 , a protein of unknown function from Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( 2BA2 ) , and the aforementioned tail-fiber protein with hyaluronidase activity from the Streptococcus pyogenes prophage SF370 . 1 ( 2C3F ) . The latter contains a coiled coil with four \u03b2-layers , one near the N-terminus , two internal , and one at the C-terminal end; the two internal \u03b2-layers have the sequence LQQKADKETVYTKAE and are thus in a hexad spacing , with the first resembling the \u03b2-layer sequence of OMP100 and the second the one of Tcar0761 . Remarkably , this second \u03b2-layer deviates from canonical \u03b2-layer structure , which we attribute to the serine in the first core position of the downstream coiled coil . This serine spans a water network in the core of the trimer , which invades the \u03b2-interactions of the \u03b2-layer with bridging waters , leading to a largely increased diameter of the layer . This wider diameter might be further promoted by the bulky tyrosine side chain of the central \u03b2-layer residue , which is bent out of the core . Nevertheless , such tandems with the consensus sequence LxxKADKxxVYTKxE occur in many bacterial ORFs ( also in some TAAs , such as Neisseria meningitidis NadA4 ) and thus probably constitute a co-optimized module . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 010Figure 7 .

\u200d\u00a0\u200d\u00a0221-NLRTMIGAGVPYSLPAA-237- A structural analysis of canonical \u03b2-layers in light of their conserved sequence patterns ( Figure 6 , Table 2 ) shows that they favor hydrophobic residues in \u03b21\u00a0and \u03b22 ( Figure 6 ) , and particularly the \u03b22\u00a0residue tends to be of smaller size ( i . e . A or V ) . They can follow upon either position a or d of the preceding coiled coil , but always lead into positions e , f , g of the following coiled coil . Thus , when they follow upon position a they yield the register a-b-c-\u03b21-\u03b22-\u03b23-e-f-g ( seen in nonads ) , whereas when they follow upon position d they bias the residue in position g towards c to yield the register e-f-g\/c-\u03b21-\u03b22-\u03b23-e-f-g ( seen in hexads ) . For the purpose of the following discussion we will refer to these two registers collectively as \u03b11-\u03b12-\u03b13-\u03b21-\u03b22-\u03b23-e-f-g . For \u03b2-layers that occur at the C-terminal end of coiled coils ( for example in the DALL1 and DALL2 domains of TAAs ) , the flanking residues do not form conserved mainchain or sidechain interactions with the layer or with each other , and their conservation pattern is dominated by interactions with the downstream domain . Since \u03b2-layers can form interaction networks that provide a C-cap to the preceding coiled coil ( see below ) , it is surprising that they do not do so in most structures where they occur at the C-terminal end of coiled coils . For \u03b2-layers that occur at the N-terminal end ( for example in the necks of TAAs or in influenza hemagglutinin HA2 ) , the \u03b23\u00a0residue acts as an N-cap for the following helix , coordinating the backbone NH group of residue g ( Figure 8 ) ; it is thus almost always D , N , T , or S ( the capping role of this residue has been described in detail in the fusion-pH structure of influenza hemagglutinin HA2 ( Chen et al . , 1999 ) . In return , the sidechain of the residue in position g forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of the \u03b23\u00a0residue , closing a ring of sidechain-backbone interactions between these two residues; it is thus almost always D , E , or Q . Where it is D or E , it can further form a salt bridge to the residue in position e of the neighboring chain ( clockwise as viewed from the N-terminus ) , which is broadly conserved as K or R . This residue essentially always forms either this salt bridge , or a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of the \u03b21\u00a0residue , as depicted in Figure 8 . This interaction network allows \u03b2-layers to form stably at the N-terminal end of coiled-coil proteins , as seen in the crystal structures of SadB , MPN010 , and the fusion-pH structure of influenza hemagglutinin HA2 . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 012Figure 8 . Interaction networks of canonical \u03b2-layers . The two distinct interaction networks of N-capping \u03b2-layers based on the sequence MATKDD and C-capping \u03b2-layers based on the sequence KADKAD are compared . The upper panels show the interactions at the first \u03b2-layer in the Tcar0761 structure and the \u03b2-layer in the A9 structure , both in top and side view . For clarity , the side views show only the interactions of the red chain . The lower panels show a schematic representation of the interactions: invariant backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bonds are drawn as bold lines , network-specific backbone-to-sidechain and sidechain-to-sidechain interactions are drawn as solid and broken lines , respectively . Grey lines indicate alternative\/additional interactions which are not formed in the depicted \u03b2-layers but can be found in other instances as described in the main text . These interactions are indicated by loose grey broken lines in the side views . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 012 \u03b2-Layers that occur within coiled coils show substantially the same interactions and conservation patterns as the ones that act as N-caps , when the residue in \u03b21\u00a0is hydrophobic . Only occasionally , the K or R in position e shows yet a third conformation , coordinating the backbone carbonyl of the \u03b12 residue of the preceding helix in the neighboring chain ( counterclockwise ) , thus providing a C-capping interaction . However , when the \u03b21 residue is K ( mainly in the stalks of TAAs and related phage proteins ) the interaction network changes entirely from an N-cap of the following helices to a C-cap of the preceding ones . The K in \u03b21\u00a0reaches across the core of the trimer to form one , two , or all three of the following interactions: coordinate the backbone carbonyls of the \u03b11 and \u03b21\u00a0residues , and the sidechain of the \u03b23 residue , all from the neighboring chain ( clockwise ) . Additionally , the K or R in position e is entirely found in the C-capping conformation . In all cases , the network is completed by backbone hydrogen bonds from the \u03b13residues to the residues in e ( clockwise ) , as already described for OMP100 ( Figure 2C ) . These considerations suggest that in a tandem of \u03b2-layers with hexad spacing , the first layer should favor a C-capping network , with K in position \u03b21 , and the second an N-capping network , with a hydrophobic residue in \u03b21 . This is in fact observed in the Streptococcus prophage tail-fiber protein ( 2C3F ) . \n The range of periodicities that \u03b1-helical coiled coils can assume is limited by the strain they impose on the constituent helices , as they progressively deviate from the 3 . 63 residues per turn of an undistorted \u03b1-helix . Insertions of 3 residues into a heptad background ( stammers , 10\/3 = 3 . 33 ) lead to the largest strain observed so far in continuous coiled coils and are accommodated by the local distortion of the \u03b1-helix into a 310 helix . We find that increasing the strain further by insertions of 2x3 or 3x3 residues leads to a complete loss of helical structure and the local formation of short \u03b2-strands . These cross to form a triangular plane , which moves the path of each chain by 120\u00b0 counterclockwise around the trimer axis . Within this plane , the central residues of the three \u03b2-strands form backbone hydrogen bonds whose geometry deviates substantially from that seen in \u03b2-sheets . We have named them \u03b2-layers and show that they can be brought about in a straightforward way by the insertion of 6 or 2 ( 9 = 2 modulo 7 ) residues into a heptad background . We propose that \u03b2-layers offer two clear advantages to protein fibers . They increase their resilience by tightly interleaving the monomers within the fiber and they offer a simple mechanism to integrate \u03b2-stranded domains into these fibers , thus increasing their functional complexity . Our results show that a novel backbone structure is accessible to the 20 proteinogenic amino acids in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with only minor mutations to a known fold . \n If not otherwise indicated , constructs were amplified by primer extension .

The amplified DNA fragment was cloned in Eco31I-sites of pIBA-GCN4tri-His ( Hernandez Alvarez et al . , 2008 ) . The Tcar0761 construct is derived from open reading frame 0761 of Thermosinus carboxydivorans Nor1 ( Genbank ZP_01667343 . 1 ) . A DNA fragment encoding residues 68\u2013101 , fused directly to a fragment encoding 191\u2013211 , was made by gene synthesis ( GenScript ) and cloned in the Eco31I-sites of pIBA-GCN4 N16V-His . The GCN4 N16V version of the pIBA-GCN4 series allows for the expression of protein fragments fused at both termini to GCN4 adaptors carrying the N16V mutation , a variant of the leucine zipper that forms a mixture of dimers and trimers . pIBA-GCN4 N16V-His was constructed by replacing the XbaI\/HindIII fragment of pASK IBA2 by a DNA fragment containing the XbaI site , ribosomal binding site , N-terminal GCN4 N16V adaptor , multiple cloning site , C-terminal GCN4 N16V adaptor , ( His ) 6-tag and the HindIII site . Aspartate residues in position f of the first heptad were replaced by methionine and tryptophan in the N- and C-terminal GCN4 adaptor as described before ( Deiss et al . , 2014 ) . Constructs A6 , T6 and T9 were amplified and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pETHis1a_Nde1 , a modified version of pETHis1a ( Bogomolovas et al . , 2009 ) allowing for expression of the constructs with a C-terminal ( His ) 6-tag and a TEV-protease cleavage site . A7 and A9 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using DNA fragment A6 as a template following the instructions of the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit . The DNA fragment coding for variant A9b was produced by gene synthesis ( GenScript ) and cloned in the NdeI and BamHI sites of pETHis1a_Nde1 . A6 , A7 , A9 , A9b , T6 and T9 were expressed in E . coli strain C41 ( DE3 ) , OMP100 and Tcar0761 constructs in XL1-blue . Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C until OD600 = 0 . 6 , then expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside . Cells were cultivated for another 5\u2009hr , harvested by centrifugation and disrupted using a French press cell ( SLM Aminco ) . All proteins were purified under denaturing conditions . 6 M guanidinium chloride was added to the cell lysate and the sample stirred for 1\u2009hr at room temperature . After centrifugation , the supernatant was loaded on a NiNTA column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 9 , 400 mM NaCl , 10% glycerol , 6 M guanidinium chloride and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0\u20130 . 5 M imidazol . Proteins were refolded by dialysis . Corresponding refolding buffers are listed in Table 1 . Refolded OMP100 was additionally subjected to a Superdex 75 column . For A6 , A7 , A9 , A9b , T6 and T9 the N-terminal histidine tags were removed before crystallization . As the TEV cleavage site turned out to be not accessible for the TEV protease , the N-terminal tag was digested with Proteinase K . Subsequent analysis of the proteins by mass spectroscopy showed intact proteins lacking only the N-terminal extension including the histidine tag and the TEV cleavage site . Crystallization trials were set up in 96-well sitting-drop plates with drops consisting of 400 nl protein solution + 400 nl reservoir solution ( RS ) and reservoirs containing 75 \u00b5l RS . Crystallization and cryo-protection conditions for all crystal structures are listed in Table 4 . All crystals were loop mounted , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , and all data collected at the SLS ( Paul Scherrer Institute , Villigen , Switzerland ) under cryo conditions at 100\u2009K using the beamlines and detectors indicated in Table 5 . Data were processed and scaled using XDS ( Kabsch , 1993 ) . Structures were solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP ( Vagin and Teplyakov , 2000 ) . For OMP100 and the GCN4-fusion constructs , trimmed models of the SadAK3 structure ( 2WPQ ) were used as search models . For Tcar0761 , fragments of the T6 and A9 structures were used . After rebuilding with ARP\/WARP ( Perrakis et al . , 1999 ) , all structures were completed in cyclic manual modeling with Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) and refinement with REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al . , 1999 ) . Analysis with Procheck ( Laskowski et al . , 1993 ) showed excellent geometries for all structures . Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 5 . Periodicity plots were calculated based on the output of TWISTER ( Strelkov and Burkhard , 2002 ) . Molecular depictions were prepared using MolScript ( Kraulis , 1991 ) , Raster3D ( Merritt and Bacon , 1997 ) and Pymol ( Schr\u00f6dinger , LLC , New York , NY ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 11861 . 014Table 4 .

{"lay_summary":"In humans and other mammals , a protein in the blood called hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body . This protein contains four subunits that can each bind to one molecule of oxygen , so a single hemoglobin can carry up to four oxygen molecules at the same time . Previous studies have found that , although each subunit can potentially bind oxygen on its own , the subunits actually work together to help each other bind to oxygen in the body . Two biochemical properties of hemoglobin affect how it carries oxygen molecules . First , oxygen-binding affinity , or how tightly the protein can bind to oxygen; and secondly cooperativity , or the degree to which the subunits interact with each other to bind oxygen more tightly . Mammals of different shapes and sizes have different requirements for transporting oxygen from the lungs to organ tissues , which have shaped their hemoglobin proteins over evolutionary timescales . While the contribution of affinity to hemoglobin evolution in animals of different sizes has been addressed in the past , the role of cooperativity in hemoglobin adapting to body size has remained unclear . Here , Rapp and Yifrach used a mathematical approach to analyze existing data from 14 different mammals \u2013 including mice , sheep , humans and elephants \u2013 on how oxygen binds to hemoglobin . Using this approach , they were able to explain why different mammalian hemoglobins present different oxygen-binding affinity and cooperativity values . Furthermore , they demonstrated that the cooperativity values were very close to the maximum they could be for each version of hemoglobin . These findings suggest that , as mammals evolved , genetic mutations that altered the oxygen-binding affinity or the ability of hemoglobin subunits to cooperate may have allowed hemoglobin proteins to adapt to meet the oxygen needs of mammals of different sizes and shapes . In the future , the approach used by Rapp and Yifrach could be adapted to study how other proteins that bind molecules in a cooperative manner have evolved .","article":"Hemoglobin ( Hb ) represents a model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates . Although both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb affect tissue oxygen delivery , only the former was thought to determine molecular adaptations of Hb . Here , we suggest that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptions that optimized tissue oxygen delivery . To test this hypothesis , we derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the \u2018biophysical Hill landscape\u2019 describing this relation . We found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen . Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb . The generality and implications of our findings are discussed . \n Two major obstacles hamper understanding the evolutionary origins of properties seen in modern-day proteins . One stems from the fact that mutation and selection are separated by several levels of biological organization such that it is difficult to elucidate the complex relationships between protein sequence and organismal\/population fitness . Second , even in those cases where the molecular properties of a protein ( e . g . affinity or cooperativity ) have adaptive value with respect to organismal fitness , we often lack an understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying changes in the values of these properties . Given these challenges , we currently understand the mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior for only a very limited number of proteins ( e . g . Mello and Tu , 2005; Keymer et al . , 2006; Swem et al . , 2008; Storz et al . , 2009 ) . Hb represents an excellent model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates ( Perutz , 1983; Poyart et al . , 1992; Hourdez and Weber , 2005; Storz and Moriyama , 2008 ) . Hb is a tetrameric allosteric protein responsible for tissue oxygen delivery in a manner controlled by the midpoint and slope of its oxygen saturation curve . These macroscopic parameters reflect the effective affinity ( p50 ) and cooperativity ( nH ) of oxygen binding by Hb , respectively and are traditionally evaluated using the Hill equation , derived assuming an all-or-none mode of binding ( Hill , 1910 ) . Over the years , many studies have indicated that Hb oxygen affinity ( p50 ) is an adaptive trait , that\u00a0is its value has been tuned during evolution so as to tailor tissue oxygen delivery to the particular metabolic requirements of vertebrates due to variations in body size , lifestyle and\/or environmental conditions . For example , vertebrates native to mountain habitats where low ambient oxygen pressures prevail usually possess Hb that exhibits higher affinity for oxygen than does the Hb of lowland dwellers ( Lenfant , 1973; Bunn , 1980; Weber , 2007; Storz and Moriyama , 2008; Storz , 2016 ) . Likewise , Hb in small-sized animals that display high metabolic rates presents lower affinity for oxygen than does the same protein in large-sized animals , again reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) . Accordingly , early respiratory system physiologists assigned great significance to the p50 parameter , terming it \u2018oxygen unloading tension\u2019 , and proposed that Hb function could be explained in terms of adaptive evolution of this value ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) . At the same time , such studies ignored the adaptive potential of cooperativity ( nH ) with respect to Hb function . This is surprising , given that nH also affects Hb tissue oxygen delivery . Moreover , mechanisms underlying changes in p50 , such as changes in oxygen affinity of the oxy- or deoxy-states of Hb , changes in the ratio between these states or changes in their sensitivity to allosteric effectors , are all also expected to affect nH . Indeed , the finding by Milo et al . ( 2007 ) that mammalian Hbs exhibit variations in the Hill cooperativity value hints at the adaptive potential of the nH trait . The need to also consider nH in addressing adaptation of Hb function becomes evident when we examine the implications of accepting the notion that molecular adaptation of Hb function in vertebrates relies primarily on its p50 affinity property . Given the inherent tradeoff between arterial O2 loading and peripheral O2 unloading , it is not clear whether improved tissue oxygen delivery is achieved by increased oxygen affinity to improve Hb loading or by decreased affinity to favor unloading ( Storz , 2016 ) . Either very high or very low oxygen affinity would result in a low fraction of tissue oxygen delivery unless cooperativity ( nH ) between Hb subunits is introduced as a means to switch between low- and high-affinity Hb states . It would thus seem that the values of both p50 and nH of Hb should reflect physiological optimization of the tradeoff between O2 loading in the lungs and O2 unloading in tissues , so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery . Although this is a seemingly obvious claim , it has yet to be tested experimentally . Here , we tested whether the values of both p50 and nH of Hb are indeed optimized in the case of body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb , relying on extensive evolutionary and physiological oxygen saturation datasets available for mammalian Hb proteins . The former comprises a set of oxygen binding curves of homologous Hb proteins from different mammalian species , all measured under similar physiological conditions ( Milo et al . , 2007; Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) . The latter comprises a set of binding curves of human Hb measured under a variety of different physiological conditions , that\u00a0is , in the presence of different concentrations of H+ , CO2 and organophosphate , all inhibitory allosteric ligands of Hb ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) . For all data sets curves , reliable estimates for p50 and nH Hill parameters and for the elementary relative affinity ( c ) and conformational changes ( L ) parameters of the MWC concerted allosteric model ( Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) are available . By deriving the explicit mathematical dependence of both p50 and nH on the MWC parameters of a tetrameric protein , we were able to draw the theoretical \u2018biophysical Hill cooperativity landscape\u2019 at half-saturation that graphically describes how nH varies with changes in the values of the MWC parameters . The mapping of experimentally\u00a0derived Hill and MWC parameters of all evolutionary and physiological dataset curves on this landscape provided insight into the mechanism underlying the adaptive behavior of p50 and nH with respect to tissue oxygen delivery by mammalian Hb and their relation to organism fitness . The principles underlying the \u2018biophysical Hill landscape\u2019-mapping strategy are general and offer mechanistic-level understanding of how physiological and evolutionary variations operate to shape the molecular property of a protein . \n The evolutionary and physiological datasets for Hb used in the current study were respectively compiled in the meta-analysis of Hb function by Milo et al . ( 2007 ) and by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) . Specifically , the Hb evolutionary dataset comprises 14 different mammalian Hb oxygen saturation curves obtained under similar physiological conditions ( Materials and methods and Supplementary file 1 ) . The Hb physiological dataset comprises 26 different human Hb saturation curves collected under a variety of different physiological conditions , including those involving changes in H+ ( Di Cera et al . , 1988; Imai , 1983 ) , CO2 ( Doyle et al . , 1987 ) and 2 , 3-BPG ( bis-phosphoglycerate ) ( Benesch et al . , 1971 ) concentrations . For each dataset curve , the magnitude of cooperativity in oxygen binding was evaluated using either the Hill ( Figure 1a ) or MWC model ( Figure 1b ) . In the former , the sigmoidal saturation curve is fitted to the Hill equation ( Equation 1 ) ( Hill , 1910 ) : ( 1 ) Y\u00af=[S]nH[S]nH+K0 . 5nHwhere Y\u00af\u00a0represents the fraction of bound sites and p50 ( ~K0 . 5 ) and nH correspond to the midpoint and slope parameters of the curve . The Hill all-or-none binding mode corresponds to a simplification that is far from what occurs in reality . Instead , Hb oxygen binding generally involves intermediate ligation and conformational species , as delineated by the MWC allosteric model ( Marzen et al . , 2013; Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) ( Figure 1b ) ( see Appendix 1 for a detailed discussion on why we think the classical MWC allosteric model adequately describes hemoglobin oxygen ligation in the presence or absence of its allosteric ligands; see also Henry et al . , 1997; Milo et al . , 2007; Rapp and Yifrach , 2017; Storz , 2016 ) . According to the MWC model , tetrameric Hb is assumed to be in equilibrium between the un-liganded low-affinity T ( tense or deoxy ) and the high-affinity R ( relaxed or oxy ) states , as described by the L allosteric constant ( L=[T]\/[R] ) . In the presence of oxygen , this equilibrium is shifted toward the R state in a manner determined by the ligation number and by the ratio of dissociation constants of oxygen from the two states , c ( c=KR\/KT ) . These aspects of the MWC model are quantitatively described by Equation 2 ( Monod et al . , 1965 ) : ( 2 ) Y\u00afMWC=\u00a0[S]KR ( 1+[S]KR ) 3+L\u00a0[S]KT ( 1+[S]KT ) 3 ( 1+[S]KR ) 4\u00a0+\u00a0L ( 1+[S]KT ) 4=a ( 1+a ) 3+Lca ( 1+ca ) 3 ( 1+a ) 4+L ( 1+ca ) 4where \u03b1 in the non-dimensional form of the MWC equation denotes substrate ( S ) concentration in KR units ( \u03b1=[S]\/KR ) . In the classical MWC model , cooperativity in substrate binding ( homotropic interactions ) is determined by both L and c ( Monod et al . , 1965 ) . Heterotropic interactions , on the other hand , describing the effects of allosteric ligands on substrate binding , only affect the L parameter . Hb conformational equilibrium can thus be further shifted toward the T state upon binding of allosteric inhibitors . Such dependence is described by Equation 3 assuming non-exclusive binding of the inhibitor ( I ) to both the T and R MWC conformations exhibiting KIT and KIR affinities , respectively ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) : ( 3 ) Lapp=L ( ( 1+I\/KIT ) ( 1+I\/KIR ) ) 4 Reliable values for the L and c MWC parameters of all evolutionary dataset Hb saturation curves and for the apparent L values of all physiological dataset human Hb saturation curves were recently reported ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) and are given in Supplementary files 1 and 2 , respectively . Values for nH and p50 for the same dataset curves were previously reported ( Milo et al . , 2007; Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) . To describe the driving force ( s ) that shape Hb affinity and cooperativity oxygen binding properties , one must first derive the exact relationship between p50 and nH and the parameters of the MWC model . Accordingly , to bridge between the non-realistic Hill analysis and the MWC ligation pathway , we followed others ( Levitzki , 1978; Yifrach , 2004 ) and employed Equation 4 ( Wyman , 1964 ) on the MWC model equation under conditions of half-saturation: ( 4 ) nH=\u2202log ( Y\u00af1\u2212Y\u00af ) \u2202 ( log\u2061[S] ) =[S]\u2202 ( Y\u00af ) \/\u2202 ( [S] ) ( Y\u00af ) ( 1\u2212Y\u00af ) Plugging the explicit mathematical expressions for\u00a0Y\u00afMWC , 1\u2212Y\u00afMWC\u00a0and \u2202 ( Y\u00afMWC ) \/\u2202 ( [S] ) into Equation 4 yields the explicit mathematical dependence of nH on the L , KR and KT biophysical parameters of the MWC model . Earlier studies ( Levitzki , 1978; Yifrach , 2004 ) employed this analysis for assessing variations of a dimeric MWC protein to obtain analytic solutions for the dependence of nH on model parameters . Here , we solved for the tetrameric MWC protein case , yielding Equation 5: ( 5 ) nHMWC=\u2202 ( Y\u00afMWC1\u2212Y\u00afMWC ) \u2202 ( log\u2061[S] ) = ( 4[S] ( \u2202 ( Y\u00afMWC ) \u2202 ( [S] ) ) ) |[S]=[S]0 . 5= ( 4[S] ( 3[S] ( 1+[S]KR ) 2KR2+ ( 1+[S]KR ) 3KR+3L[S] ( 1+[S]KT ) 2KT2+L ( 1+[S]KT ) 3KT ( 1+[S]KR ) 4+L ( 1+[S]KT ) 4\u00a0\u2212 ( 4 ( 1+[S]KR ) 3KR+4L ( 1+[S]KT ) 3KT ) ( [S] ( 1+[S]KR ) 3KR+L[S] ( 1+[S]KT ) 3KT ) ( ( 1+[S]KR ) 4+L ( 1+[S]KT ) 4 ) 2 ) ) |[S]=[S]0 . 5 The expression for [S]0 . 5 can be obtained by setting Y\u00afMWC ( Equation 2 ) to a value of 0 . 5 . Given that [S] is raised to a power of up to 4 , the exact analytic expression for [S]0 . 5 ( L , KR , KT ) is not manually solvable and was obtained using Mathematica software ( Wolfram Research Inc; see Materials and methods ) . Substituting the solution for [S]0 . 5 ( L , KR , KT ) in Equation 5 then allows obtaining the explicit expression for nHMWC in terms of the MWC model parameters . The long and complex expressions of both [S]0 . 5 and nHMWC\u00a0can be found at the GitHub repository under the following address: https:\/\/github . com\/OlgaRL\/MWC_Parameters ( Rapp , 2019; copy archived at https:\/\/github . com\/elifesciences-publications\/MWC_Parameters ) . Thus , for any L , KR and KT values , nHMWC\u00a0is unequivocally determined ( Equation 5 ) . A good approximation for nH ( based on the [S]0 . 5 expression of the R\u00af conformational state function; Gruber et al . , 2019 ) that is over 98% accurate across most of the range of L and c values is presented in Appendix 2 . Plotting the three-dimensional surface of the Hill slope at half-saturation ( now referred to as nHMWC ) as a function of both logL and logc ( based on equation 5 ) generates what we refer to as the theoretical \u2018biophysical Hill landscape\u2019 for a tetrameric MWC protein ( Figure 1c ) . This landscape graphically describes the parameter space available for such a MWC protein and summarizes many of the known cooperativity-related aspects of the MWC model documented in classical papers ( Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966; Edelstein , 1975; Perutz , 1989 ) and textbooks . In the Hill landscape , nHMWC values between one to four are obtained as a function of the L and c values chosen . The nHMWC surface presents a topology that resembles an upward-running ridge , with the maximum points obtained by introducing various L and c values ( as indicated by the trajectory drawn in red ) . Such mapping is better appreciated in the bell-shaped dependence of nHMWC on logL at a given logc value ( c\u00a0=\u00a00 . 01 , a value typical for human Hb ) , seen in a cross-section of such a surface ( Figure 1d ) ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966; Edelstein , 1971 ) . Inspecting the landscape cross-sections reveals that systematically higher maximum Hill points are obtained when higher L and lower c values are simultaneously chosen . Furthermore , as indicated by Rubin and Changeux ( 1966 ) , the different L and c value pairs underlying the maximum nHMWC points must all fulfill a particular dependence expressed by L\u00a0=\u00a0c -n\/2 , as obtained by setting \u2202nH\/\u2202logL equals zero . Another important aspect of the maximum Hill points is that they reside at the apex of rather wide hilltops . This can be seen in the bell-shaped cross-sections of nHMWC as a function of logL at any particular logc value ( Figure 1c , d ) , suggesting that around the maximum cooperativity points , only minor changes in nH are to be expected upon changes in L brought about by binding of allosteric inhibitors or activators ( Equation 3 ) . This relative insensitivity of nHMWC to changes in physiological conditions was referred to as a \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 phenomenon by the MWC model founders ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966; Edelstein , 1971 ) . Using the biophysical Hill landscape described here , we can now examine where evolutionary and physiological considerations have affected Hb behavior . Where along the three-dimensional nHMWC landscape can one find the ( L , c , nH ) points of the different binding curves of the evolutionary and physiological Hb datasets ? We first considered the 14 mammalian oxygen saturation curves comprising the evolutionary dataset . As can be seen in Supplementary file 1 , the different mammal Hbs exhibit variations in both L and c values , thus giving rise to different Hill values ( calculated based on the MWC model using Equation 5 ) . These values resemble the observed \u2018Hill model\u2019-derived coefficients ( Milo et al . , 2007 ) , as indicated by the linear correlation between the observed and calculated Hill values reported by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) ( Figure 1 therein; see also Supplementary file 1 ) . When mapped onto the theoretical Hill landscape , the calculated Hill values of all mammalian Hbs reside close to the maximum points of the bell-shaped contours of the three-dimensional Hill landscape ( Figure 2a ) . Furthermore , the logarithms of the values for L and c of the different Hbs are linearly correlated ( Figure 2b ) with a slope value of \u22122 . 7 ( \u00b10 . 3 ) , close to a value of \u22122 that would be expected for proteins that evolved to present maximum cooperativity in ligand binding ( L\u00a0=\u00a0c -n\/2 ) . The observation that the logL-logc correlation crosses very close to the ( 0 , 0 ) axis origin point further supports this assertion . Given that L and c are independent parameters of the MWC model , the logarithms of their values for a given protein set are not expected to be linearly-dependent . This is , in particular , true if one considers that these values were derived using reliable data fitting strategies that prevent potential parameter dependence artifacts ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) and that changes in either c or L ( or in both ) were reported for native or mutant Hb variants over many years of Hb research . We thus suggest that the observed linearity between mammalian logL and logc values does not imply causation or is an artifact but rather points to co-evolution of the two MWC parameters so as to shape Hb cooperativity close to the maximum value . Deviation between the observed and expected slope values of the logL-logc correlation can be explained by differences in the techniques and experimental protocols used to evaluate the Hb saturation data from the different organisms and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis ( for detailed discussion , see Milo et al . , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , even with such limitations , the results derived from the evolutionary dataset support the hypothesis that changes in mammalian Hb binding and conformation have been tuned during evolution , giving rise to close to maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding , albeit yielding a different maximum nH value in each case . To further examine whether this indeed is the case , we considered the human Hb physiological dataset . As highlighted above , a buffering of cooperativity regime is observed around a maximum cooperativity Hill point . As such , minor changes in nH are to be expected upon changes in L brought about by the binding of allosteric inhibitors or activators . Reliable estimates for the apparent L values of all of 26 different concentration-related saturation curves of the H+ , CO2 and 2 , 3-BPG physiological datasets were recently obtained ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) , assuming a constant c value in each case , as predicted by the MWC model ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The different Lapp values obtained for each effector dataset saturation curve scales with effector concentration in a manner predicted by the MWC model ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017; Appendix 1 ) , confirming the reliability of the values derived . For the physiological Hb dataset , a cross-section of the biophysical Hill landscape at the characteristic c value of human Hb should be considered . We thus examined where along the bell-shaped human Hb nH-logL curve do the characteristic pairs of logL-nH values of the 26 physiological dataset curves reside . As can be seen in Figure 3a , logL-nH data points of the physiological dataset ( black symbols ) cluster around the maximum point of the bell-shaped curve . This pattern is in sharp contrast to the scattered pattern of the pairs of logL-nH values for Hb mutants reported in the literature ( gray circles ) ( Baldwin , 1976 ) and assumed by Baldwin ( 1976 ) ( and later by Fersht , 1985 ) to have the same c value . Significant deviations from the maximum cooperativity value of wild-type human Hb were also observed for naturally occurring Hb mutants , such as the Kansas and Chesapeake variants ( Edelstein , 1971 ) . A clustering pattern similar to that shown for human Hb is also seen for bovine and dog Hbs , despite being based on the limited physiological datasets available for these species ( Figure 3b ) ( Jensen , 2004; Breepoel et al . , 1981 ) . The clustering of all logL-nH experimental data points of the H+ , CO2 and 2 , 3-BPG datasets around the maximum point reveals that the Hill value for human Hb is relatively insensitive to changes in physiological conditions . Such nH-insensitive behavior was noted for the pH-related Bohr effect of Hb ( Wyman , 1964; Di Cera et al . , 1988 ) and later extended to other allosteric effectors of Hb ( Milo et al . , 2007 ) . Our results showing the invariance of nH with respect to logL thus provide a mechanistic explanation , based on the MWC model parameters , for the \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 property of Hb . Such behavior should only appear if human Hb had evolved to present maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding ( Figure 1c , d ) . As site-directed point mutants of Hb are not subjected to the selection pressure that leads to maximum cooperativity , the values of logL-nH pairs for such mutants fall off the extremum point of the logL-nH cross-section ( Baldwin , 1976 ) . We next explored the potential evolutionary and physiological advantages of setting Hb cooperativity around the maximum nH point . We asked the following questions: Does the value of the maximum Hill point determine the sensitivity of Hb to tissue oxygen unloading ? Does the value of the maximum nH point affect the dynamic range of the buffering of cooperativity phenomenon ? How is Hb protein unbinding sensitivity changes within the buffering of cooperativity range ? To answer these questions , we turned to Equation 2 and the biophysical Hill landscape ( Figure 1c ) . Using the MWC equation , we generated ligand saturation binding curves exhibiting increasing maximum Hill cooperativity values ( Figure 4a ) . This was achieved by appropriate selection of L and c values ( indicated in Table 1 ) , all fulfilling the L=c-2 parameter criterion . To allow direct comparison , the saturation curves were plotted as a function of the scaled concentration \u03b1 ( =[S]\/KR ) , as is commonly done ( Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) . Under such conditions , the affinity and maximum Hill point are correlated ( Figure 4a ) . The higher the value of the maximum Hill point of the appropriate binding curve , the more it is displaced to the right along the scaled concentration axis . This is reflected in Figure 4b , showing monotonic correlation between the maximum Hill value and log\u03b11\/2 ( \u03b11\/2=[S]1\/2\/KR ) . It thus seems that under the maximum cooperativity parameter condition , a tradeoff exist between the cooperativity and affinity properties of a MWC-type protein . We next examined if and how this tradeoff affects the sensitivity of the protein for substrate unbinding upon chemical potential change . For each of the curves presented in Figure 4a , we considered the chemical potential difference ( \u0394log\u03b1 ) needed to achieve a constant reduction in the fractional saturation from 100 to 40% , as typically observed for mammalian Hb saturation under physiological lung and tissue oxygen pressures ( 100 and 40 mmHg , respectively ) . The \u0394Y\u00af100\u00a0\u2192\u00a040%\/\u0394log\u03b1 parameter depends on both the affinity and cooperativity attributes of the binding curve and reflects the sensitivity of the MWC protein to substrate unloading . The narrower the difference in chemical potential that results in a 60% reduction in fractional saturation , the higher is the sensitivity of the protein to substrate unbinding . As can be seen in Figure 4c ( filled black symbols ) , the value for this parameter increases monotonically in a power law manner with increases in the value of the maximum Hill point . Similar results were obtained when other \u0394Y\u00af ranges were considered ( e . g . \u0394Y\u00af100\u00a0\u2192\u00a020%; not shown ) . Higher maximum Hill points thus ensure higher sensitivity for substrate unbinding by the MWC protein . We next addressed the dynamic range implicated in physiology adaptation . The maximum nH points of the different curves shown in Figure 4a reside precisely at the apex of the appropriate bell-shaped nH-logL curve , calculated using the appropriate c value ( Figure 4d and Table 1 ) . As mentioned earlier , around this maximum nH point cooperativity is invariant to changes in L brought about by binding of allosteric modulators . To assess the broadness of the buffering of cooperativity regime around each maximum cooperativity point , we next generated a set of physiological dataset curves by systematically changing the value of L by several orders of magnitude , such that the resulting saturation curves exhibited essentially the same Hill value for ligand binding as did the original maximum Hill value ( less than a 1% change ) . This ensured that our analysis remained within the \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 region , characteristic of each maximum Hill value ( see the yellow-marked logL range highlighted in each of the curves in Figure 4d ) . One such physiological dataset generated\u00a0around\u00a0the maximum point of human Hb ( nH\u00a0=\u00a0~2 . 8 ) is shown in Figure 4e . For curves based on other maximum cooperativity points , see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 . For each of the different datasets , we calculated the logL range between the two extreme binding curves and defined this value ( \u0394logL ) as the broadness of the buffering of cooperativity regime , or the dynamic range for physiological adaptation where only affinity ( p50 ) matters . Plotting the dependence of \u0394logL on the maximum cooperativity Hill value ( Figure 4f ) reveals that higher maximum Hill values give rise to broader L ranges , where \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 is observed . The maximum Hill point thus further controls the dynamic range of physiological adaptation . Lastly , we considered how protein sensitivity to substrate unbinding , as defined above , varied within the yellow marked buffering of cooperativity regime ( Figure 4d ) . Thus , for each set of fractional saturation curves calculated around the different maximum cooperativity points and residing within this regime ( Figure 4e and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , we calculated \u0394Y\u00af100\u00a0\u2192\u00a040%\/\u0394log\u03b1 . Variations in this parameter are plotted as open yellow symbols around each of the maximum cooperativity points presented in Figure 4c , with the lower and upper data points , respectively , corresponding to the lower and upper logL values defining the boundaries of this range . As can be seen , within this range , changes of up to 6% are observed in the value of protein unbinding sensitivity in response to changes in physiological conditions brought about by changes in L alone yet reflected in changes in p50 alone . The fact that different mammalian Hbs exhibit different maximum nH values ( Figure 2a ) , combined with the observation made above whereby systematically higher maximum Hill value gives rise to higher sensitivities\u00a0to\u00a0substrate unloading by MWC proteins ( Figure 4c ) , led us to hypothesize that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply . We thus returned to the datasets comparing oxygen saturation of different mammalian Hbs ( all measured using similar methodology ) that revealed the linear correlation between animal metabolic rate and logp50 ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) . We are aware that these data may not necessarily reflect functional effects on a single Hb form . Still , in cases where adult mammalian Hb expresses more than one variant , both usually present similar sequences and functional properties ( Storz , 2016 ) . Rather than taking the affinity-centric approach employed in the earlier studies , we instead adopted a complementary cooperativity-centric mindset and re-fitted all of the saturation curves to the Hill equation to derive both nH and p50 values for Hb of each animal ( Figure 5a and Table 2 ) . The derived nH values , although obtained under the slightly different physiological conditions typical of the blood of each animal , nevertheless correspond to maximum cooperativity values , as nH is relatively invariant to physiological changes around the maximum point ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . This assertion is further strengthened by the results shown in Figure 5b describing the linear relation between affinity ( logp50 ) and cooperativity ( nH ) , as expected for parameter values underlying maximum cooperativity ( Figure 4b ) . Finally , plotting either the affinity ( ~log ( 1\/p50 ) ) or cooperativity properties of Hb as a function of the logarithm of metabolic rate of an animal yielded linear correlations in both cases ( Figure 5c ) . Specifically , the greater an animal\u2019s metabolic rate , the higher was the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb . Furthermore , as previously shown ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) , an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity . These empirical observations directly relate the maximum cooperativity and affinity properties of Hb to an organismal-level trait that is related to fitness ( Dykhuizen et al . , 1987; Kacser and Burns , 1981; Bershtein et al . , 2017 ) . \n Our findings revealed that mammalian Hb cooperativity values have been tuned during evolution to reside on a ridge of the theoretical biophysical Hill cooperativity landscape describing a MWC protein ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . These ridge-located Hill values all correspond to maximum cooperativity extremum points and were achieved by tuning of the relative affinity ( c ) and conformational ratio ( L ) of the T and R quaternary states of the protein ( Figure 2 ) . These maximum points are thus unique points along the Hill cooperativity scale continuum . There is no a\u00a0priori reason to expect that physiological and evolutionary diversity in Hb would be reflected by this low dimensional ridge feature of the Hill landscape . As can be seen in the three dimensional Hill landscape , many combinations of L and c values can give rise to the same Hill value . Yet , only one of these combinations obeys the L\u00a0=\u00a0c\u22122 maximum cooperativity criterion . The observed variations in maximum cooperativity Hill values among mammalian Hb proteins thus reflect co-evolution of binding and conformational changes of Hb . Such tuning gives rise to a buffering of cooperativity effect , suggesting that the degree of cooperativity is robust to changes in physiological conditions brought about by tuning L alone ( Figure 3 ) . Our results thus reveal the evolutionary strategy underlying the observed variations in Hb behavior . The functional advantages of the balance between the relative affinity and conformational ratio of Hb quaternary states underlying the maximum Hill point become clear when considering that both the affinity and cooperativity parameters of Hb saturation curves affect tissue oxygen unloading . First , the c-L tradeoff gives rise to the highest possible Hill value for any given c value , thereby ensuring maximal oxygen unloading upon Hb transfer from the lungs to other tissues ( Figure 1cd ) . Either very high or very low L values would give rise to hyperbolic oxygen saturation curves with an nH value of one ( Figure 1c ) , which would ensure poor and unregulated tissue oxygen unloading by Hb . The same is true when c is assigned the value of one . Second , tuning the Hb maximum Hill point to higher values further leads to greater sensitivity to tissue oxygen unloading ( Figure 4c filled , symbols ) . Third , parameter adjustments that lead to higher maximum nH values also give rise to reduced Hb oxygen affinity ( p50 ) ( Figures 4b and 5b ) , thus reinforcing oxygen unloading upon Hb transfer from the lungs to other tissues . Indeed , the affinity-cooperativity tradeoff typical of the ridge of maximum cooperativity suggests that cooperativity can compensate for changes in affinity , with respect to tissue oxygen unloading , as usually described in any Biochemistry textbook . Fourth , the balanced parameter values give rise to the \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 regime , thus ensuring that the nH-related oxygen unloading effect is not compromised in response to physiological changes brought about by variations in L and reflected as changes in p50 . Indeed , under such a regime , relatively minor changes in Hb sensitivity for oxygen release are expected in response to changes in allosteric effector binding ( Figure 4c , open symbols ) . Finally , the co-varied c and L values underlying maximum cooperativity allow for control of the broadness of the \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 regime ( Figure 4d , f ) . Taken together , these points support the assertion that mammalian Hb nH and p50 values reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that serve to optimize the tradeoff between O2 loading in pulmonary capillaries and O2 unloading in tissue capillaries , so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery . Based on experimental ( Figures 2 and 3 ) and theoretical ( Figure 4 ) results , we suggest that evolutionary ( i . e . , across species ) variations allow for gross changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity . Such changes are controlled by the maximum cooperativity and affinity values of Hb , in turn determined by changes in both L and c ( Figure 4c , filled symbols ) . Fine-tuning changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity may further be brought about by physiological variations within the buffering of cooperativity regime , this time , however , reflected in changes in L and p50 alone ( Figure 4c , open symbols ) . The linear dependence between the metabolic rate of an animal and the maximum Hill value for Hb ( Figure 5c ) , combined with the results presented in Figure 4c , indicates that nH , like p50 , carries adaptive value with respect to mammalian Hb tissue oxygen unloading . As such , small body-sized animals presenting high metabolic rates require high oxygen supplies that can be more efficiently delivered by Hb presenting higher maximum Hill values . Considering that an animal\u2019s metabolic rate is a trait related to organism fitness , we suggest that both the affinity and cooperativity traits of Hb represent low dimensional components of the fitness landscape , independent of other components . In this respect , the biophysical nH landscape of Hb can be regarded as a biophysical fitness landscape that serves to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap in assessing the relation between sequence variations in Hb ( that affect its affinity and cooperativity properties ) and their ensuing fitness effects ( Bershtein et al . , 2017 ) . Evolutionary tuning of mammalian Hb maximum cooperativity and affinity points , achieved by co-varying the relative affinity and conformational ratio of its quaternary states , thus regulates tissue oxygen delivery by Hb and serves as one mean to meet the distinct needs of different animal tissues for oxygen ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . Clearly , other mechanisms related to cardiac output and to convective and diffusive steps in the oxygen transport pathway are as well contribute to modulation of tissue oxygen transport ( reviewed in Schmidt-Nielsen , 1975 ) . For example , it has been shown that the capillary density of a mammal is also inversely correlated to body size ( Schmidt-Nielsen , 1975 ) . The buffering of cooperativity regime in Hb reflects the case where the fractional saturation curves of the protein seem parallel in shape and are only displaced along the substrate concentration axis in response to changes in effector ligand concentrations ( see Figure 4e ) . As revealed by Olsman and Goentoro ( 2016 ) , it is exactly this behavior the qualifies a MWC protein as a logarithmic sensor , reflecting the capacity of the protein to respond identically over a broad range of changes in chemical potential . Such behavior is in contrast to the case where the protein sensor responds to the absolute value of the signal intensity . Upon surveying the literature , Olsman and Goentoro ( 2016 ) found that many MWC allosteric proteins , including phosphofructokinase , Hb , cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels , Tar receptors , G-protein coupled receptors and EGF receptors exhibit a buffering of cooperativity or logarithmic sensing regime in response to changes in the concentration ( or magnitude ) of the modulatory allosteric signal . The dynamic range for this behavior can vary from 10-fold ( Hb ) to 10 , 000-fold ( GPCR ) . These findings suggest that all these MWC proteins evolved to present maximum cooperativity values in ligand binding and operate under the L\u00a0=\u00a0c -n\/2 parameter regime that gives rise to the buffering of cooperativity phenomenon . However , other than Hb , the significance of this finding to organismal fitness is known only in the case of a single protein ( Keymer et al . , 2006 ) . Realizing the physiological advantage ( s ) of attaining the maximum cooperativity point of any protein and its relation to organismal fitness , is , of course , case-specific . Finally , the roadmap that underlies the \u2018biophysical Hill landscape\u2019-mapping strategy is general and can be applied to reveal the relation between evolutionary ( i . e . sequence ) and physiological ( e . g . changes in metabolite concentrations ) variations in shaping any molecular property of a protein . Although operating on different time scales and through different mechanisms , these traits are linked through the biophysical model describing the function of the protein . Elucidating this linkage requires extensive physiological and evolutionary datasets of the protein and that the steady-state biophysical model describing the function of the protein is known so that the explicit mathematical dependence of the molecular property under study on biophysical model parameters can be elucidated . This allows for constructing a \u2018biophysical molecular property landscape\u2019 onto which experimentally\u00a0derived values of the macroscopic and microscopic parameters of all physiological and evolutionary dataset measurements can be mapped . Rationalizing the pattern of such mapping in terms of the relation between model parameters reflecting particular protein processes , such as catalysis , binding or conformational changes , might then reveal the driving forces that shape the molecular property under study . \n The functional data analyzed here considered the evolutionary and physiology Hb datasets respectively complied in Milo et al . ( 2007 ) and Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) . The evolutionary dataset comprised oxygen saturation curves of Hb from 14 different mammal samples obtained under similar physiological conditions . Using a three-equation system strategy ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) , the values for the L and c MWC allosteric parameters of all dataset curves were recently reported ( Supplementary file 1 ) . The physiological dataset comprised four independent human Hb sub-datasets , obtained from three different labs , with two reporting pH modulation , one considering CO2 modulation and the last addressing 2 , 3-BPG modulation , as discussed in the meta analyses by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) . These sub-datasets each include between 5\u00a0and\u00a07 oxygen saturation curves obtained at different effector concentrations . Using global fitting analysis , we recently reported reliable estimates for the apparent L values for the different concentration-related physiological datasets curves ( see Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 and Supplementary file 2 ) . Cooperativity in oxygen binding by Hb was assessed using the Hill or MWC models , as quantitatively described by Equation 1\u00a0and 2 . The dependence of nH at half-saturation ( nHMWC ) on the MWC elementary parameters was obtained by applying Equation 4 to the MWC equation , assuming Y\u00afMWC equals \u00bd . Explicit solving for [S]1\/2 in terms of KR , KT and L was obtained using the Mathematica 11 . 2 software package ( Wolfram research Inc ) . Substituting this expression in Equation 5 using the same software yields the explicit expression for nHMWC ( at half-saturation ) in terms of the MWC model parameters . It should be noted that nHMWC ( at half-saturation ) is an approximate measure of\u00a0nH , maxMWC , the more natural Hill value for specifying homotropic cooperativity in the framework of the MWC model ( Rubin and Changuex , 1966 ) . In our analysis , we used nHMWC rather than the nH , maxMWC as the former is the actual parameter that is usually evaluated when fitting experimental data to the Hill equation ( Equation 1 ) . As for\u00a0nH , maxMWC , the expression for nHMWC at half-saturation also exhibits a bell-shaped dependence on L , thereby also describing the characteristic \u2018buffering of cooperativity\u2019 effect . Furthermore , nH , maxMWC\u00a0is equal to nHMWC exactly at the maximum cooperativity point ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) . It should be emphasized that the nHMWC expression derived here relates to cooperativity in ligand binding ( as it is calculated based on\u00a0Y\u00af ) and is different than the expressions for nH derived in other studies based on the active state function ( R\u00af\u00a0in the case of an enzyme or P\u00afopen in case of an ion channel ) and which relates to cooperativity of conformational switching ( Einav and Phillips , 2017; Martins and Swain , 2011; Marzen et al . , 2013 ) . For plotting the three-dimensional Hill landscape ( nHMWC ) as a function of both logL and logc , a constant KT ( =143 mmHg , the average value for KT in the evolutionary dataset ( See Supplementary file 1 ) and varying KR parameters were used . The Hill biophysical landscape shape , however , is invariant to other choices made for changing the relative affinity c parameter . Simulated MWC-based Y\u00af data were generated using Equation 2 by changing the appropriate biophysical parameters ( KT , KR or L ) , as described in the text and in figure legends . For evaluating the sensitivity of oxygen unloading , simulated MWC-based Y\u00af curves were first generated around several maximum cooperativity values by systematically changing c and adjusting L so as to fulfill the Lc2=1 maximum cooperativity criterion . Nevertheless , since scaled Y\u00af curves are presented , the analysis is invariant to parameter choice . Around each maximum cooperativity graph , the dependence of nHMWC on the allosteric constant L was plotted assuming the appropriate constant c value in each case . To extract Y\u00af data from previously published graphs , the WebPlotDigitizer net-based program was used . Only experimental data points were sampled unless the reported graph presented the experimental trend by a continuous line rather than scattered data points , as is typical of saturation data presented in older manuscripts . In such cases , the curves were evenly sampled by taking systematic steps along the x-axis . Y\u00af\u00a0data were fitted using either the Hill or MWC equations ( Equation 1 and 2 , respectively ) . The adequacy of fit was judged based on attaining a R2 coefficient greater than 0 . 97 .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["biochemistry and chemical biology"],"id":"elife-47640-v1"}
{"lay_summary":"In dry caves of southeastern Brazil , live a group of insects named Neotrogla that are perhaps best known because the egg-producing females have penises while the sperm-producing males have vaginas . The sex roles of these Brazilian cave insects are also reversed: females compete over the males , who in turn are selective of their female partners . This sex role reversal likely evolved within Neotrogla because the males\u2019 semen represents a rich and reliable source of energy within a nutrient-poor cave environment . When females are not using semen to fertilize their eggs , they consume it . Yet , while other animals show sex role reversal , Neotrogla species alone have reversed sexual organs . Neotrogla penises are spiky and may have evolved so that females can anchor themselves to males and then mate for prolonged periods . This would allow the females to stock up on the nutritious semen . Compared to their closest relatives , Neotrogla species can hold twice as much semen within their sperm storage organs . Scientists have speculated that a valve-like structure within this organ enables this extra storage by allowing the female to redirect semen into two separate chambers . But the organ\u2019s small size has made it difficult to determine its inner workings , and scientists have yet to discover a switching valve that serves such a purpose within the animal kingdom . Yoshizawa et al . examined three Neotrogla species using advanced imaging technology and detected the first example of a biological switching valve . Neotrogla females can control this valve , switching the flow of semen between two slots . In this way , females can store two batches of semen at once . Seemingly exploiting this adaptation , the females\u2019 spiky penises help them restrain males until they have received multiple semen injections . Yoshizawa et al . therefore suggest the emergence of this valve within the sperm storage organ may have promoted the evolution of the female penis . Along with giving insight into the lives of cave insects , these findings are of interest to engineers , who face challenges when constructing valves on a microscopic scale . The unique switching valve of female Neotrogla may one day inspire new man-made machinery that could advance a range of industries .","article":"We report a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla . The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites , a closure element , and in-and-outflow canals . Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen . The semen is packed in a capsule , whose formation is initiated by seminal injection . It is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition . The valve complex has two slots for insemination so that Neotrogla can continue mating while the first slot is occupied . In conjunction with the female penis , this switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections . The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla . \n Many man-made engineering solutions have evolved already in insects . Such examples include hinges ( flapping flight enabled by the wing base: Brodsky , 1994 ) , on-off valves ( spiracle openings to regulate airflow: Chapman , 1998 ) , backflow valves ( the bombardier beetle's defensive spray: Arndt et al . , 2015 ) , coiling mechanisms ( genital tubes: Matsumura et al . , 2017a ) or catapult-like mechanisms ( the legs of many jumping insects: Burrows , 2013 ) . Some mechanisms that were formerly thought to be unique to human engineering have been discovered recently in insects: biological screws have been found in a beetle's leg ( van de Kamp et al . , 2011 ) , and interacting gears were found in the jumping legs of planthoppers ( Burrows and Sutton , 2013 ) . The design and construction of such mechanisms on a micrometer scale is a challenging task in engineering ( Feinberg et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , studies of micron-scale biological structures can be rewarding as they illuminate construction principles in insects that could be applied to technical solutions in engineering ( Matsumura et al . , 2017b ) . The genus Neotrogla ( family Prionoglarididae ) is a minute Brazilian cave insect belonging to the order Psocodea ( booklice , barklice , and parasitic lice ) . This genus is of special evolutionary and morphological interest because of the reversal in its genital structures ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . The females of Neotrogla have a penis-like intromittent organ ( gynosome: Figure 1A ) , which is inserted to a male vagina-like genital cavity for copulation . During mating , the male injects liquid semen into the female\u2019s sperm storage organ ( spermatheca ) through the opening of the spermathcal duct at the tip of the female penis . Within the spermatheca , the injected semen then induces the formation of a hard capsule shell around itself ( Figure 1A , B: Wearing-Wilde ( 1995 ) ; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Although there is only a single inlet spermathecal duct present , occasionally two seminal capsules are attached simultaneously to a plate-like structure on the spermatheca ( termed \u2018spermathecal plate\u2019: [Lienhard et al . , 1893; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014] ) . The semen within the capsule is used not only for fertilization but is also consumed by the female as nutrition . To compete for nutritious semen , the direction of sexual selection is reversed in Neotrogla ( sex-role reversal: Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Each seminal capsule is voluminous ( ~0 . 05 mm3 , corresponding to\u00a0~300 ml scaled up to humans ) , and the duration of the copulation is very long ( for 40 to 70 hr ) . In a closely related species lacking reversal of genital structure ( Lepinotus patruelis , Trogiidae ) , the seminal transfer for forming a similarly voluminous seminal capsule is known to complete in 50 min ( Wearing-Wilde , 1995 ) . The female penis of Neotrogla bears a lot of spines , by which females anchor a male coercively during copulation . Therefore , females are obviously responsible for this very long copulation , probably to obtain more semen from a male ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . After consumption of the semen , the empty capsule is detached from the plate , which is kept within the spermatheca . Because females frequently have empty capsules within the spermathecal pouch ( in an extreme case , up to nine empty capsules and two filled ones attached to the plate were observed: Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) , female Neotrogla can be considered polyandrous , which is apparently controlled actively by the female . Although several examples of sex-role reversed animals induced by seminal gifting have been reported , Neotrogla so far is the only example with a morphological reversal of its intromittent organs ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa , 2017 ) . This morphological reversal seems to require further upstream modifications of the genital system , such as the formation of the spermathecal plate , which was reported as an additional novelty tightly associated with the seminal gifting ( Lienhard et al . , 1893; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . However , the detailed morphology and function of this spermathecal plate , which presumably plays an important role in the evolution of the female penis , remained unclear due to the extremely small size of the involved subcomponents and their fragile spatial composition . In this study , we investigated the structure of the spermathecal plate by using a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) and high-resolution synchrotron microcomputed tomography ( HR-\u00b5CT ) to assess the functional morphology of sperm storage and control of seminal flow . We examined three species of Neotrogla ( N . brasiliensis , N . aurora and N . truncata ) , the spermathecal morphology of which is practically identical ( Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) . Based on the results , we discuss the evolutionary significance of this plate during the evolution of the reversed intromittent organs in Neotrogla . \n The spermatheca of Neotrogla is in principle composed of an extensible pouch for storage of the seminal capsule , a spermathecal plate divided into two interconnected sclerites ( body sclerites 1 and 2: Sc1 and 2 hereafter ) , and the spermathecal duct , which discharges into the spermathecal plate ( Figure 1CD , Video 1 ) . The terminology used for the following description is summarized in Table 1 . The switching valve mechanism is located at the spermathecal plate . Sc 2 is a bowl-shaped chitinous structure harboring a fan-like muscle ( the actuator ) , which originates at its ventral part and attaches to a thumb-shaped controller\/closure element ( CE: Figures 1CD and 2A\u2013D ) . Given their attachment area , the force range of each muscle bundle is between 0 . 0758\u20130 . 6562 mN ( assuming a standard intrinsic muscle force of 33 N\/cm\u00b2: David et al . , 2016 ) . The CE is located at the dorsal connection of Sc1 and 2 , where the spermathecal duct opens into the pouch ( Figure 2A\u2013D ) . In the virgin female , Sc 2 is connected to Sc 1 laterally through an interlock-like structure composed of several ridges on both sides that fit into each other ( Figure 1F ) . This is the location where seminal capsules are formed during copulation ( Figure 1G ) . Both Sc1 and Sc2 possess a system of patches of resilin , a rubber-like protein found in arthropod cuticles wherever potential energy is stored for spring-like motions or bending of structures . The region surrounding the CE contains extensive resilin patches ( Figures 1CD and 2 ) . Two larger patches are located where the seminal capsules are attached so that this region can expand to harbor the base of the seminal capsule ( Figure 1DF ) . Another resilin-rich region is located around the valve mechanism ( Figures 1CD and 2 ) , where the resilin serves to passively keep the valve opening in the closed position . Opening of the valve can only occur through activation of the actuator muscle bundle . In the fixed material analyzed , the muscle bundles are contracted due to the fixation process . Therefore , the switching valve is in an opened position in Figures 1\u20132 . The seminal fluid entering the main lumen of the duct can be directed into the left or right channel depending on the position of the CE . If the left part of the actuator muscle is activated , the CE is moved to the left , so that a channel on the right side opens , which then allows for seminal flow into the right capsule ( Figure 2E ) . A small lateral extension at the distal end of the CE serves to close the opposite channel during the opening of the other channel ( Figure 2DE ) . If the right part of the actuator is activated , the process is executed in reverse . In a female fixed during copula , seminal flow from the duct opening lumen toward one of two seminal capsules was clearly observed ( Figure 1E ) . Seminal flow can thus be directed by the female through differential muscle activation that moves the CE . Measurements of each structure and the estimated power produced by the discernible muscle bundles mentioned above are summarized in Table 2 . \n The present analyses show that females of Neotrogla use a special mechanism to actively control the direction of seminal flow ( Figures 1E and 2A\u2013D ) . This biological switching valve allows females to receive two seminal packages ( i . e . , more nutrition ) from the same or different males within a short time span . In particular , the switching valve allows to receive a second seminal capsule while the first one is consumed . A similar but less sclerotized structure can be observed in close relatives of Neotrogla ( Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla , all belonging to the tribe Sensitibillini ) , suggesting that the structure probably originated in their common ancestor ( Lienhard , 1893; Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) . Neotrogla is distributed in South America , whereas Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla are distributed in southern Africa . Therefore , the origin of this switching valve dates to at least the break-up of the two continents , over 100 million years ago ( Seton et al . , 2012 ) . In other psocodeans , no sclerite or muscle corresponding to those of the spermathecal plate elements have been observed ( Badonnel , 1934; Klier , 1956; Wearing-Wilde , 1995 ) . The spermathecal plate thus clearly represents an evolutionary novelty ( M\u00fcller and Wagner , 2003 ) . The mechanism of flow control and redirection within this biological switching valve is fundamentally different from that in man-made switching valves , which are used , for\u00a0example in the oil and gas industry . Technical switching valves use the active rotation of tube or ball elements with various openings to redirect the flow and both closing as well as opening involve an active movement of the valve . In contrast , the observed biological switching valve involves a passive movement component . The seminal flow injected by a male is redirected by a differential inclination of the CE ( Figure 2E ) . This inclination is due to the fan-like geometry of the actuator muscle whose parts can pull the CE in the preferred direction to work against the passive closing forces generated by the resilin patches around the valve complex . This muscle-closure element configuration could be advantageous since each muscle bundle pulls in an optimal direction to incline the CE into one of the two opening positions . Additionally , there is no need for lubrication since the moveable parts do not move against each other . Compared to technical switching valves , this design is advantageous to some extent because the muscle forces are not redirected via a lever arm . The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus . Female-female competition for males ( sex-role reversal ) to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered as the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Among all animals with known sex-role reversal , Neotrogla is the only example in which a female penis evolved ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa , 2017 ) . In a close relative of Neotrogla , the barklouse species Lepinotus patruelis ( Wearing-Wilde , 1996 ) , the sex-roles are also reversed , but the species possesses normal genital structures . Therefore , it is very likely that , in addition to the sex-role reversal , there is at least one other key factor that enabled the evolution of a female penis . Although females of all three known genera of Sensitibillini possess a spermathecal plate , females of Sensitibilla do not have a penis-like organ ( Lienhard , 1893; Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) . This strongly suggests that the evolution of the spermathecal plate , possibly including a switching valve , preceded the evolution of the female penis . The spermathcal plate has two slots available for insemination ( Figure 1E ) . In Neotrogla and the related species ( Lepinotus ) , content of the capsule is digested as nutrition during the seminal capsule being attached to the spermathecal plate ( the transparent capsule shown in Figure 1B is a digested and empty one: Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , if there is only one slot for insemination , as in the spermatheca of Lepinotus , females cannot receive another capsule while digesting one . With the switching valve , the female Neotrogla ( and possibly Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla ) can selectively use one of two slots for insemination , with leaving the other slot empty . This enables the females to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males by using the empty slot . Males are predicted to prudently allocate limited resources , such as nutritious seminal gifts and sperm , to multiple females , especially when operational sex ratio is biased to females , rendering female-female competition for male-derived nuptial gifts ( i . e , propensity for multiple mating ) more intense ( Abe and Kamimura , 2015 ) . The male-holding organ ( spiny female penis ) and female-induced long copulation durations of 40\u00a0\u2013\u00a070 hr ( compared to just\u00a0~50 min for formation of one seminal capsule in close relatives ) in Neotrogla ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) thus can be considered as exaggerated adaptations for such escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats ( Lienhard and Ferreira , 2013; Lienhard and Ferreira , 2015; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . The condition of having two freshly deposited spermatophores at once is comparable to that in multiple sperm storage organs reported for females of some animal groups , such as dung flies , Drosophila , or tephritid fruit flies ( Ward , 1993; Pitnick et al . , 1999; Twig and Yuval , 2005 ) . Although theory predicts that having multiple sperm stores can be a powerful mechanism for choosing sperm ( Hellriegel and Ward , 1998 ) , evidence is scarce for a gain in fitness by actively selecting for particular sperm from among multiple mates ( e . g . , Demont et al . , 2012; Sch\u00e4fer et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , in the case of Neotrogla and related barklice ( Lepinotus patruelis ) , the content of the seminal capsule is digested quite rapidly if not used for fertilization ( Wearing-Wilde , 1995; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits ( i . e . , for obtaining more nutrients ) rather than for genetic benefits ( i . e . , for choosing sperm from high-quality males ) . \n Three species of Neotrogla were examined . We detected little interspecific variation in the basic mechanism of the spermathecal plate . A virgin female of Neotrogla brasiliensis ( Caboclo Cave , Janu\u00e1ria , Minas Gerais , Brazil , 12 . iii . 2016: Figures 1DF and 2A\u2013C: voucher ID S8KY03 ) and a copulating pair of N . truncata ( Toca dos Ossos Cave , Ourol\u00e2ndia , Bahia , Brazil , 14 . i . 2013: Figure 1EG: voucher ID S8KY69: full shape data provided as Video 1 ) were used for \u00b5CT examination ( http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 6084\/m9 . figshare . 6741857 ) . Neotrogla brasiliensis was fixed with FAA solution ( formaldehyde-acetic acid-alcohol ) and N . truncata was fixed with 80% ethanol . Both samples were then stored in 80% ethanol . Dehydration was conducted in ascending order with 80\u00a0\u2013\u00a0100% ethanol before drying them at the critical point ( EM CPD300 , Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) to remove water without serious organ shrinkage . Samples were then scanned using synchrotron microcomputed tomography at the BL47XU ( Uesugi and Hoshino , 2012 ) beamline of the Super Photon ring-8 GeV ( SPring-8; Hyogo , Japan ) using a stable beam energy of 8 keV in absorption-contrast mode . The tomography system consists of a full-field X-ray microscope with Fresnel zone plate optics ( Uesugi et al . , 2017 ) . The FOV and effective pixel size are 0 . 11 mm\u00b2 and 0 . 0826 \u03bcm\u00b2 , respectively . We used semiautomatic segmentation algorithms based on gray-value differences in the software ITK-SNAP ( Yushkevich et al . , 2006 ) to obtain 3D representations of the genitalia of Neotrogla . Rendering of the mesh objects was carried out using the software BLENDER ( blender . org ) . Objects were imported as stl files , surface meshes were slightly smoothed , and the number of vertices were reduced without altering the 3D geometry . No further processing was applied . All measurements were carried out in BLENDER . A virgin female of N . brasiliensis ( Figures 1C and 2D: voucher ID: CLKY1 ) was also used for confocal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM ) observation ( Leica TCS SP5 , Wetzlar , Germany ) . The spermathecal plate was removed and mounted on a glass slide with glycerol . We used an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 510\u00a0\u2013\u00a0680 nm , detected using two channels and visualized separately with two pseudocolors ( 510\u00a0\u2013\u00a0580 nm\u00a0=\u00a0green; 580\u00a0\u2013\u00a0680 nm\u00a0=\u00a0red ) . To visualize resilin , we used an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 420\u00a0\u2013\u00a0480 nm , detected on one channel and represented with a blue pseudocolor . A virgin female of N . aurora ( Gruta Couve-Flor cave; Aurora do Tocantins , Tocantins , Brazil , 7 . i . 2009 ) was used to take the whole-abdomen photo shown in Figure 1A . The abdomen was removed from a fixed specimen and soaked in Proteinase K at 45\u00b0C overnight and stored in glycerol . Photographs were taken with an Olympus E-M5 digital camera attached to an Olympus SZX16 binocular microscope ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Partially focused pictures were combined using Helicon Focus ( Helicon Soft Ltd . , http:\/\/www . heliconsoft . com ) to obtain images with a high depth of field . The holotype female of N . truncata ( Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) was used for photographing the spermathecal plate shown in Figure 1B . Photographs were taken with an Olympus E-M5 attached to a Zeiss Axiophot compound light microscope ( Oberkochen , Germany ) .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["evolutionary biology"],"id":"elife-39563-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"Forgetting is a common experience in our everyday life . Yet much remains unknown about how we remember , and about why our memories sometimes fail us . The brain contains 80 to 100 billion nerve cells or neurons , which communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . At a synapse , one neuron releases a chemical message , which must diffuse across a small gap , and then activate proteins called receptors on another neuron . If the first neuron activates the second repeatedly , the second cell responds by inserting additional receptors into its membrane at the synapse . This strengthens the connection between the two neurons . Strengthening of synapses is thought to be one of the key mechanisms underlying learning . To confirm this , it would be helpful to be able to monitor the movement and position of individual receptors at synapses . However , the space between the two nerve cells at at synapse , called the synaptic cleft , is no more than 40 nanometers wide . This is about 25 times thinner than a human hair , and too small to be seen with light microscopy . Electron microscopy can visualize synapses , but does not work in living tissue . The only other option is to attach a fluorescent label \u2013 either a dye or a man-made crystal called a quantum dot \u2013 to a protein found in synapses and monitor the resulting fluorescence . Though the probe must be small enough to pass through the synaptic cleft to do this . Using fluorescence microscopy , researchers have examined the distribution in synapses of proteins called AMPA receptors , which have a key role in memory . Multiple studies have shown groups of AMPA receptors gathered outside synapses . This has led to the suggestion that during learning , AMPA receptors wait outside the synapse until a space becomes available within the synapse\u2019s membrane . However , this has yet to be confirmed directly , in part because conventional fluorescent dyes and quantum dots are too bulky to enter synaptic clefts when bound to a receptor . Lee et al . have now developed a quantum dot that is only 10 nanometers wide and therefore small enough to enter the synaptic cleft with an AMPA receptor attached . These small quantum dots were then used to label AMPA receptors in neurons collected from rats and then grown in a petri dish , which provided a completely new view of synapses . The images show that the majority of AMPA receptors in neurons circulate within confined domains \u2013 a little like holding pens \u2013 inside the synapse , rather than waiting outside as previously assumed . Labeling the receptors with smaller 4-nanometer-wide fluorescent tags produces a similar picture . Further work is still need to determine how AMPA receptors get into the synapse and contribute to new memories .","article":"Previous studies tracking AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) diffusion at synapses observed a large mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR pool . Using super-resolution microscopy , we examined how fluorophore size and photostability affected AMPAR trafficking outside of , and within , post-synaptic densities ( PSDs ) from rats . Organic fluorescent dyes ( \u22484 nm ) , quantum dots , either small ( \u224810 nm diameter; sQDs ) or big ( >20 nm; bQDs ) , were coupled to AMPARs via different-sized linkers . We find that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or sQDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs , which were stable for 15 min or longer . Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile . In contrast , 5\u201310% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90\u201395% were extrasynaptic as previously observed . Contrary to the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD \u2018slots\u2019 , our findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable \u2018nanodomains\u2019 in PSDs with lifetime >15 min , and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes . \n A major goal of cellular and molecular neuroscience is to characterize how synapses change during synaptic plasticity , the leading cellular correlate of learning and memory ( Volk et al . , 2015; Huganir and Nicoll , 2013; Kneussel and Hausrat , 2016 ) . The position and dynamics of the two major ionotropic glutamate receptors ( iGluRs ) , \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( AMPARs ) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDARs ) , are critical for synaptic strength . AMPARs traffic intracellularly from sites of synthesis and assembly to exocytosis sites near synapses ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012; Henley et al . , 2011; Greger and Esteban , 2007 ) . Despite much elegant work , it is still unclear what mechanisms limit AMPAR entry into and exit out of PSDs ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ) ( Park et al . , 2004 ) ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . The different steps involved in AMPAR trafficking at synapses under constitutive conditions ( no plasticity ) are depicted schematically in Figure 1a . As shown , AMPAR trafficking consists of its exo- and endocytosis at sites on the plasma membrane ( steps 1 and 1\u2019 , respectively ) , diffusion to and from these sites and PSDs ( steps 2 and 2\u2019 ) and entry into and exit from PSDs ( steps 3 and 3\u2019 ) . The positioning of the AMPAR endo- and exocytosis sites with respect to PSDs is uncertain with some evidence for endo- and exocytosis sites within spines relatively close to PSDs ( Kennedy et al . , 2010; Lu et al . , 2007 ) , other evidence that the sites are on dendrite shafts outside of spines ( Yudowski et al . , 2007; Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) , and also that both locations may exist regulated by synaptic plasticity ( Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . Another complication is that the recycling pathway under constitutive conditions may be different from the pathway with synaptic plasticity ( Zheng et al . , 2015; Henley et al . , 2011 ) . This suggests that different endo- and exocytosis sites may exist under constitutive conditions versus synaptic plasticity . In the last decade , advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques have pioneered work on iGluR dynamics ( Heine et al . , 2008; Groc et al . , 2007; Nair et al . , 2013; MacGillavry et al . , 2013; Kneussel and Hausrat , 2016 ) . Commercial or \u2018big\u2019 quantum dots ( bQDs ) with a diameter\u00a0>20 nm were observed ( at least occasionally ) within synaptic clefts of inhibitory synapses by electron microscopy ( Dahan et al . , 2003 ) . bQDs are extremely bright , photostable and their position can be localized to within\u00a0~10 nm in the millisecond time-scale ( Pinaud et al . , 2010 ) . Studies of AMPARs tagged with bQDs led to the conclusion that 50\u201380% of AMPARs are extrasynaptic and highly mobile ( Groc et al . , 2007; Opazo et al . , 2010 ) . This significant highly mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs has been proposed to exist because of the slow rate that extrasynaptic AMPARs enter PSDs . This slow rate of motion and accumulation of extra-synaptic AMPARs is thought to occur because of the limited availability of \u2018slots\u2019 in PSDs ( See Figure 1a , route 3 ) ( Shi et al . , 2001; Opazo et al . , 2012 ) . Slots are defined as placeholders for AMPARs in PSDs ( Malinow et al . , 2000 ) . Once in PSD slots , AMPARs are generally assumed to be immobilized , although Nair et al . observed that AMPARs underwent constrained diffusion in what they defined as \u2018nanodomains\u2019 , that\u00a0is sub-synaptic regions where AMPARs are confined to ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . New slots may become available when AMPARs exit from PSDs ( route 3\u2019 ) or if more slots are created or removed by different forms of synaptic plasticity ( Malinow et al . , 2000; Shi et al . , 2001; Malinow , 2003; Giannone et al . , 2010 ) ( Groc et al . , 2007; Heine et al . , 2008 ) ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) ( Makino and Malinow , 2009 ) ( Opazo et al . , 2012 ) ( Henley and Wilkinson , 2016 ) . The presence of such a large pool of mobile AMPARs on the extrasynaptic surface of dendritic membranes is thought to be an important contributor to the mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity such as LTP and could help synapses recover from pair-pulse depression during periods of fast synaptic transmission ( Heine et al . , 2008; Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . To avoid the potential problem of using large probes , other workers have used single particle tracking ( spt ) of small ( <5 nm ) fluorescent probes permanently ( generally via a linkage protein ) or temporarily bound to an AMPAR . One such technique is called sptPALM ( spt- photoactivated localization microscopy ) where an iGluR is fused with a photoactivatable fluorescent protein ( pa-FP ) ( Manley et al . , 2008 ) . Another technique is called universal points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography ( uPAINT ) which measures an organic fluorescent probe that is temporarily bound to the receptor ( Sharonov and Hochstrasser , 2006; Giannone et al . , 2010 ) . However , there are contradictory results using these methods . Using uPAINT , AMPARs were found to be highly mobile ( Giannone et al . , 2010 ) , or stationary ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . Using sptPALM and FRAP , another fluorescence technique , workers found that AMPARs were highly mobile . However , fluorescent proteins for sptPALM and FRAP are sensitive to both internal and external AMPAR receptors , which may obfuscate the issue ( Nair et al . , 2013; Heine et al . , 2008 ) ( Makino and Malinow , 2009; Ashby et al . , 2006 ) . Determining whether AMPARs or other neurotransmitter receptors are synaptic ( outside PSDs ) or extrasynaptic ( inside PSDs ) has been difficult because of four factors: ( 1 ) Synapses are nanometer in scale below the diffraction limit of visible microscopy; ( 2 ) Most microscopy has been limited to two-dimensions , where in reality , the dimensions are three-dimensional; ( 3 ) Recombinantly tagged imaging probes cannot readily distinguish intracellular vs . cell-surface receptors; ( 4 ) Probe photostability limits the localization precision and the length of image acquisition , particularly for single-molecule studies . Here we use 3-dimensional super-resolution microscopy on cell-surface AMPARs labeled with different-sized fluorescent probes\u2014bQDs ( >20 nm ) , small quantum dots ( sQD \u224810 nm ) ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) or organic fluorophore ( \u2248 4 nm ) in cultured neurons . These probes are highly fluorescent; bQDs are nearly infinitely photostable; sQDs are photostable for several minutes; and selected organic fluorophores can be photostable for\u00a0~1 min . We analyzed the diffusion constants , trajectories , distances from the center of PSDs , changes that occurred over time after transfection , and the role of the extracellular matrix in regulating diffusion . To better resolve PSD dimensions , we used 3-D super-resolution imaging of a PSD protein , Homer1c . We find that\u00a0>\u00a090% of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes or sQDs are found in PSDs . Less than 10% of these labeled AMPARs are highly mobile and extrasynaptic . However , when AMPARs are labeled with bQDs , virtually all AMPARs ( 90\u201395% ) are highly mobile and extrasynaptic , presumably because bQDs are sterically hindered from entry into synaptic clefts . We conclude that mobile AMPARs enter PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously observed in studies using the AMPARs labeled with bQDs . Our data further suggest that AMPAR entry is not regulated by a limited number of \u2018slots\u2019 where AMPARs are bound after entry into PSDs . Instead AMPARs are found to diffuse within surprisingly stable \u2018nanodomains\u2019 confining AMPARs to sites within PSDs that may regulate access to presynaptic glutamate release . \n We labeled surface-expressed tagged ( AP-tag or EGFP ) versions of the GluA2 subunits of the AMPAR receptor . They were transiently transfected into cultured rat hippocampal neurons and imaged at 13\u201316 days in vitro ( DIV ) ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods , and [Howarth et al . , 2005] ) . Three different fluorophores and ligands for coupling to AMPAR were used ( Figure 1c ) : ( 1 ) a small organic fluorophore coupled to streptavidin ( SA ) ; ( 2 ) a sQD with three different ligands: a limiting amount of SA such that each sQD has approximately one SA; a 13kD single-chain antibody against GFP ( from alpaca , commercially known as the Green Fluorescent Binding Protein , or GBP ) , which has only one target on a GFPN-term-AMPAR ( Ries et al . , 2012; Rothbauer et al . , 2008; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . ( In one case , it has also been directed to a pHluorin-AMPAR , a GFP-derivative ( Ashby et al . , 2004 ) . The result for this construct is the same as GFPN-term-AMPAR ) ; ( 3 ) a monomeric streptavidin ( mSA ) , which has only one binding site for biotin and was further molecular engineered from a recent one ( Lim et al . , 2013; Lim et al . , 2011; Chamma et al . , 2016 ) , in order to minimize non-specific labeling with neurons ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The SA and mSA were used with the same AMPAR constructs as used with the bQDs . The ( tetrameric ) SA was used at a ratio of one per sQD . A commercial bQD containing many streptavidins was also used ( Figure 1c ) . Homer1c ( tag with mGeos or mEos3 . 2 ) was co transfected to generate a super-resolution marker for PSDs . For all experiments , imaging was performed using a cylindrical lens for 3D reconstruction ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) . We noticed that most surface AMPA receptors labeled with SA-bQD one day following transfection ( DIV14 ) , reside in a widely spread extra-synaptic region ( Figure 2a and e ) . This is consistent with our previous results ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) with the difference that the microscope stage drift and chromatic aberrations are corrected in this study . Chromatic aberration was corrected to with 4 nm ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . The drift was corrected to within approximately 2 nm in x and y , and 16 nm in z ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) . ( See also Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1\u20137 ) . We also labeled AMPARs with a SA-sQD ( which is approximately half the diameter of the bQDs or 1\/8th the volume ) and measured the distance of the AMPAR to the center of PSDs marked by Homer1c-mGeos . Qualitatively , the receptors are often in nanodomains , sub-synaptic regions where the receptor is confined ( Figure 2b , f; also , Figure 4d and e ) . The distance between the center of Homer1c cluster to the center of the AMPAR-sQD is close: a maximum of 150\u00b142 nm , with 75% and 91% of receptors being localized within 0 . 5 \u00b5m and 1 . 0 \u00b5m , respectively , of Homer1c . Lastly , we also employed organic dyes to observe the diffusion of AMPA receptors in live neurons ( Figure 2c and g; summarized in Table 1 ) . This allows a direct comparison of AMPA receptors labeled with bQD and sQD and those labeled with organic fluorophores in live neurons . One advantage of the uPAINT technique using organic dyes compared to sptPALM is that the uPAINT technique only labels cell-surface receptors if cell-impermeable organic dyes are used . By choosing fairly photostable dyes , uPAINT also allows a relatively long time ( limited by the photobleaching ) for the motion to be measured . Here , we find that AMPARs labeled with organic-fluorophores on live cells are colocalized with Homer1c ( Figure 2c ) . To measure the overall population of AMPARs within one synapse , as opposed to the behavior of an individual AMPAR , we obtained super-resolution ( direct-STORM ) images for neuronal receptors using a heavily labeled organic fluorophore ( SA-Cy3B ) after fixing the neurons ( Figure 2d and e ) ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . Cy3B is particularly good with STORM because it can be made photoactivatable with NaBH4 ( Vaughan et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , we can label extensively with many organic fluorophores because the hydrodynamic diameter of organic fluorophores is\u00a0~1 nanometer and even when conjugated with streptavidin , they are only about 4 nm in diameter ( Diki\u0107 et al . , 2012 ) . Consequently , SA-organic dyes are significantly smaller than either bQDs or sQDs or even labeled-antibodies ( which are commonly used to label AMPARs ) . In addition , non-specific labeling was insignificant . These findings were similar to those obtained using sparsely labeled sQDs and organic dyes labeling on live neurons . Thus , by all three techniques ( with sQDs , with live- and fixed-neurons labeled with organic fluorophores ) we find that the localization of AMPA receptors is predominantly at the synaptic regions . In addition , we observe in these fixed samples , that there is typically one nanodomain per synapse ( Figure 2h ) , although multiple nanodomains do exist ( Figure 2j ) . For all fluorescent tags , \u2018heat maps\u2019 were created to plot the diffusion constants ( in \u03bcm2\/s ) versus the AMPAR trajectory range ( in \u03bcm ) ( Figures 3\u20135 ) . In general , the lower left-hand corner of the map shows the diffusion of AMPARs where the trajectory range is limited , constrained by PSD ( or slot ) proteins ( Shi et al . , 2001; Opazo et al . , 2012 ) , and the diffusion coefficient of these receptors was slow; those in the upper right-hand corner are not constrained and move faster . Semi-quantitatively , we define \u2018slow\u2019 as D \u2264 10-1 . 75 ( 0 . 018 ) \u03bcm2\/s and \u2018constrained\u2019 as a trajectory range of \u2264 10-0 . 1 ( 0 . 79 ) \u03bcm . These criteria were used as rough guidelines to be consistent with previous work ( Constals et al . , 2015 ) ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) . The 2D heat maps can also be plotted as a function of DIV to see the effect of transfection time ( see Figures 3\u20135 ) . Alternatively , the 2D heat maps can also be turned into regular 1D histograms by compressing one axis and fitting the data to a series of Gaussian fits ( see Figures 3\u20135 ) . Importantly , because many cells were measured , ( 6\u201313 different culture plates from at least four independent culture preparations , corresponding to 483\u20131599 synapses ) , 2D histograms should be independent of absolute number of synapses ( synaptogenesis ) . We used bQDs and were able to reproduce results from previous work showing large pools of receptors outside of the synapses . At post-transfection day one there are primarily two peaks in the heat map in Figure 3a with the majority ( 73% of all AMPAR , peak\u03b1 ) having a fairly fast diffusion constant ( 10-1 . 25=0 . 056 \u03bcm2\/s ) with about a\u00a0~\u00a01 . 3 \u03bcm travel length , and a minor peak ( 27% , peak \u03b2 ) having slower diffusion constants ( 10-2 . 5=0 . 0032 \u03bcm2\/s ) and smaller trajectory ranges ( \u2248 0 . 5 \u03bcm ) . As illustrated in Figure 3c , AMPARs in the \u03b1 peak are localized outside the synaptic spine on the dendritic shaft distant from Homer1c labeling . Furthermore , the AMPARs are undergoing free diffusion confined over large ( >1 um ) regions in the dendritic shaft . The \u03b2 peak has two components , both of which are diffusing slow . 5% of all AMPARs are colocalized with PSDs labeled by Homer1c; 22% are not localized to a labeled Homer1c ( see Figure 3d ) . This 22% component could be confined extrasynaptic AMPARs , ( possibly due to crosslinking ) , or they could be diffusing at PSDs not labeled by Homer1c . On post-transfection day 3 , the heat map in Figure 3b is significantly changed with a broader distribution of the diffusion coefficients and trajectory range , covering the range seen at post-transfection day 1 . Unlike the result at post-transfection day 1 , the population of free diffusion ( i . e . the \u03b1 peak ) has significantly decreased , while the population of slow diffusion ( i . e . the \u03b2 peak ) has increased . The data also show that the fraction of the slow diffusion is significantly increased on post-transfection day 3 , as compared with that on post-transfection day 1 . A representative trajectory is shown in Figure 3e , which shows the peak \u03b3\u00a0of the bQD undergoing limited-diffusion in a small region far from synapses similar to the \u03b2 peak in Figure 3a . For the bQDs , we measured AMPAR diffusion as a function of DIV ( Figure 3a vs . b ) . All labels were examined after 1 day and after 3 days , following transfection , corresponding to DIV14 and DIV16 , respectively . Because we observed a change in mobility we reasoned that this could be due to cross-linking of AMPAR by the multivalent bQD , or due to an increase in the amount of extracellular matrix . Both factors are known to influence the diffusion of surface-expressed AMPARs ( Chamma et al . , 2016; Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) . ( This result is further described in Figure 6 . ) Regardless of the exact reason , the fact that labeling with bQDs is a function of the number of DIVs is problematic . When using sQDs , we found no accumulation of large pools of extra-synaptic receptors . Instead , we found that motion is largely constrained-diffusion in PSD nanodomains . The heat maps for the AMPARs labeled with sQDs ( Figure 4 ) are strikingly different from the heat maps for AMPARs labeled with bQDs ( Figure 3 ) . First , the diffusion with any of the three different linkers resulted in much slower diffusion , with a diffusion coefficients\u00a0~\u00a010-2 . 5 \u03bcm2\/s . Results were different depending on which linker was used with the mean diffusion constant varying from 10-2 . 41\u00b10 . 02\u03bcm2\/s for the SA linker ( Figure 4a ) , which is largest and multivalent ( Figure 1b ) , 10-2 . 53\u00b10 . 02\u03bcm2\/s for the GBP linker ( Figure 4b ) , which intermediate in size and monovalent and 10-2 . 59 \u00b1 0 . 02\u03bcm2\/s for the mSA linker ( Figure 4c ) , the smallest and monovalent . These results suggest that both the size as well as the valency of the probe can influence the measurements . More specifically , these trends yield 75% ( 70% ) , 82% ( 92% ) and 84% ( 86% ) slowly moving , that\u00a0is a vast majority of AMPAR-sQDs display constrained diffusion . ( The numbers in parenthesis correspond to taking the integrated area under the Gaussian fit ) . By looking at the diffusion constants , one sees a distribution of constrained diffusion: 84 , 100% and 96% . Both results are in direct contrast with the results for labeling with the bQDs . In addition , the diffusion constant for AMPARs linked via SA to sQD is somewhat broader than the sQD coupled to GFP via GBP , which is somewhat broader than the mSA . ( The mSA result is approximately equal to the smaller organic fluorophores\u2014see below ) . This possibly implies that , although SA-sQDs are significantly better than the bQD to label AMPARs , smaller ligands ( like mSA ) or organic-fluorophores ( coupled via SA: see below ) are better to study synaptic receptors in neurons . We find that labeling with sQD to AMPAR is not a function of DIV , as day 14 is essentially identical to day 16 , for all three ligands used . This says that the diffusion time and trajectory is a not a function of time , and therefore that the time-dependence , possibly due to cross-linking and differential interaction with extracellular matrix , is not a problem for sQDs-AMPARs . This gives us confidence about our results with sQDs . We note that heat maps tell about the range of diffusion of AMPAR , but do not give the absolute distance from the PSD . Rather it is the trajectory range of receptors which does this ( Figure 2e\u2013j , or Figure 3c\u2013e , or Figure 4d\u2013g ) . To get whether the AMPAR is labeling near or in the PSD , we plot in Figure 4f , the histogram of the distance of AMPAR from the center of Homer1c . The histogram shows that 75% of receptors are localized within 0 . 5 \u00b5m of Homer1c and 91% within 1 . 0 \u00b5m , generally undergoing constrained-diffusion ( Figure 2d , f ) . This strongly implies that the great majority of AMPARs are within the PSD . This further implies that our labeling strategy using the small probes does not limit access to the synaptic cleft . We also need to take into account those sQDs that are bound to AMPARs but not in a synapse . ( For the bQDs , this was 22\u20135%=17% . ) We find that there is 12% of labeled mSA-sQD-AMPAR undergoing constrained diffusion not around a labeled Homer1c . Whether this is due to AMPAR constrained within a PSD containing an unlabeled Homer1c , or constrained within some other domain , is not known . These results are similar to AMPARs labeled with sQDs . We labeled AMPARs using SA-Atto647N or SA-CF633 ( Figure 5 ) . Both of these dyes are bright , especially when several dyes are conjugated per streptavidin , and fairly photostable , >50 s observation time ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . ( Why we get this enhanced photostability is unclear . ) In addition , Atto647N has a positive charge and is relatively hydrophobic , whereas CF633 is negatively charged and hydrophilic ( Zanetti-Domingues et al . , 2013 ) . Somewhat better , more specific labeling was shown with CF633 . Overall , these factors have been found to be significant in terms of the measurement of the diffusion of membrane proteins ( Zanetti-Domingues et al . , 2013 ) . A heat map shows that the diffusion constants and range of AMPARs are both quite small when labeled with Atto647N ( post-transfection day 1 and day 3 ) and CF633 ( post-transfection day 1 ) ( Figure 5a and b ) . The results for Atto647N at various concentrations ( 0 . 1\u20131 nM ) are similar ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . There is a slight difference between the two dyes chosen , which indicates that CF633 might have more specific labeling . With Atto647N , fitting the trajectories regardless of the diffusion constants , there is 27% of the AMPAR which has longer trajectory range and larger diffusion constants ( Figure 5a ) ; these are not much present with the CF633 dye , where we find 93% are constrained in nanodomains ( Figure 5b ) . Finally , Figure 5c is the image of the main peak , \u03b1 in Figure 5a , which shows that AMPAR is not just constrained , but is constrained around the PSD . Figure 5d indicates that 81% of AMPAR-SA-CF633 is localized within 0 . 5 \u00b5m of Homer1c , and this number increases to 98% within 1 \u03bcm . Similarly , for Atto647N , 78% is within 0 . 5 \u00b5m and 84% within 1 \u00b5m of Homer1c . For fixed neurons , labeled with Cy3B , the results are similar Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) : 85% of the receptors are localized within 0 . 5 \u00b5m of Homer1c . For any of the dyes chosen , whether fixed or live , they indicate a close association between the Homer1c and AMPARs . We imaged native AMPARs labeled with antibody ( GluA2 ) -Alexa647 and measured the distance between native AMPARs and Homer1c clusters using fixed neurons which we transfected with Homer1-mGeos . As shown in Figure 5e and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4 , the results show that 71% of AMPARs are localized within 0 . 5 \u03bcm , and 96% within 1 \u03bcm . This is very similar to the Atto647N and CF633 shown in Figure 5d ( 78-98% ) . The results using endogenous AMPARs labeled with antibodies indicate that the overexpression of GluA2 does not significantly affect the measurements . The extra-cellular matrix ( ECM ) is a dense meshwork structure in surrounding brain cells ( Sykov\u00e1 and Nicholson , 2008 ) . In neurons , surface receptors such as AMPARs and NMDARs , possibly interact directly or indirectly with the ECM , so that the ECM may affect the lateral diffusion of surface receptors in the synapses and surrounding locations ( Dityatev and Schachner , 2003 ) . Recent studies have shown that the ECM is also involved in the mechanism of recruiting glutamate receptors through lateral diffusion ( Dityatev and Schachner , 2003; Dityatev et al . , 2010; Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) ( Frischknecht and Gundelfinger , 2012 ) . In particular , one recent study claimed that when the ECM was enzymatically removed , the extra-synaptic AMPA receptors moved at a higher diffusion rate and the exchange of synaptic receptors was increased ( Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) . They therefore concluded that the ECM might regulate short-term synaptic plasticity . However , the observations were on AMPARs labeled by bQDs , so their conclusions should be re-examined in light of our results above . We therefore compared AMPARs labeled with bQDs and sQDs on untreated cultured neurons and on neurons in which ECM was removed using Hyaluronidase . Recall that with bQD , in the presence of ECM ( Figure 3a and dotted lines in Figure 6a ) , we have two populations of AMPAR-bQD: 73% are fast moving ( D\u00a0~\u00a010-1 . 20 \u00b1 0 . 01\u00a0=\u00a00 . 063 \u00b5m2\/s ) over a large distance and 27% are slow moving ( D\u00a0~\u00a010-2 . 0 - 10-3 . 0 \u00b5m2\/s ) , and constrained to be approximately 0 . 5 \u03bcm from the Homer1C . After ECM removal , we find that the slow-moving ones ( the \u03b2 peak in Figure 3a or the white dotted line in Figure 6b ) are gone . All of the remaining AMPAR-bQDs freely diffuse outside of synapses on the membrane of dendrites . In contrast , with small qdots , we observe that the average and distribution of the diffusion coefficient of AMPA receptors was almost the same before ( Dave=0 . 015\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 0006 \u00b5m2\/s ) ( Figure 6b , dotted line ) and after ( Dave=0 . 013\u00b10 . 0004 \u00b5m2\/s ) ECM removal ( Figure 6c ) . Thus , sQD-tagged AMPAR diffusion is not significantly affected by the presence of ECM , presumably because virtually all of these AMPARs are confined to PSDs where diffusion is limited by interactions with PSD scaffold proteins . Only the bQD-tagged AMPARs , which are virtually all extrasynaptic , are significantly affected by ECM . These results provide an explanation for the changes that occur in the diffusion and trajectories of the bQD-tagged AMPARs going from DIV 14 to 16 in Figure 3a and b . As the neurons develop in culture , progressively more ECM is deposited on the neuronal membrane going from DIV 14 to 16 thereby reducing AMPAR diffusion and trajectories . We find that AMPARs labeled with sQDs differ from AMPARs labeled with bQDs in being able to consistently enter synaptic clefts and nanodomains within PSDs . We observe the same behavior with AMPARs labeled with organic fluorophores . The feature that distinguishes sQDs from organic fluorophores is the significantly longer photostability of the sQDs compared to the \u2248 1 min lifetime with the organic fluorophores . Using AMPARs labeled with sQDs we examined the stability of AMPAR nanodomains in PSDs over 15 min , exciting the sQDs for 30 s at a time , every 5 min . A previous study observed that most nanodomains were stable for up to one hour , but some nanodomains were dynamic , appearing and disappearing within minutes ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . This other study , however , used AMPARs labeled with either organic fluorophores or recombinant fluorescent proteins , which limited the imaging to the ensemble average of AMPAR in PSDs . They were therefore unable to observe the dynamics of single receptors except for much shorter times ( <<minute ) , corresponding to the photobleaching time of organic fluorophores . Here we used sQDs to study the dynamics of the nanodomains of the same AMPAR in synapses for long periods ( from 15 min repeatedly , and up to 60 min occasionally ) of time . A total of 126 synapses were observed . As shown in Figure 7 , we first located AMPARs for 30 s , immediately followed by PSD imaging using Homer 1 c super-resolution . AMPARs were then imaged three times more , every 5 min for 15 min , and PSD imaged one final time ( Figure 7a ) . The finite photostability of the fluorescent protein prevented the Homer1c from being monitored more than this . The dendrite morphology was also imaged using a transfected near-IR FP , which fills the cytoplasm of the dendrite ( Figure 7b ) . The nanodomain of the AMPAR , which was\u00a0~\u00a0200 nm , remained in approximately the same position in the synapse for the entire fifteen minutes . As shown in Figure 7c and d , when imaged at the beginning ( AMPAR-red , Homer1c-green ) and the end of the fifteen-minute period ( AMPAR-blue , Homer1c-brown ) , the synapse itself had changed position only slightly . To see how much the synapse had drifted over the 15 min , we aligned the images . We first made a linear adjustment , moving both the AMPA receptor trace and the Homer1c cluster about 100 nm and we then rotated the trace and cluster 19\u00b0 to align them ( Figure 7c ) from one perspective and from then rotated the synapse 10\u00b0 , perpendicular to the first axis , as shown in Figure 7d . With these relatively minor adjustments , the two images of the synapse nearly perfectly overlapped ( right hand side of Figure 7c , d ) . In addition , Figure 7e shows that the shape of the trace of the AMPAR ( ~200 nm in size ) observed at 0 , 5 , 10 and 15 min , remained quite constant . This indicates that the nanodomain , defined by the constrained area of a single AMPAR , was extremely stable for the fifteen-minute measurement period . Occasionally , AMPAR nanodomains were observed to move within PSDs ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Using the same protocol , the AMPAR nanodomain was first observed at the very edge of the PSD ( 0 min ) after which the nanodomain moves further within the PSD and does not move further . As shown in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ( b\u2013d , the shape and size of the AMPAR nanodomain changes little ( Figure 7f ) , and only the nanodomain position changed after the initial time-point . In one example we also imaged a highly mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR enter into a nanodomain in PSD ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . As shown , the AMPAR during the initial time point is widely diffusing near a spine but outside of the PSD . During the last time 15 min time-period , the same AMPAR enters a nanodomain at the edge of the PSD . These images suggest that AMPARs immediately enter nanodomains as they arrive at PSDs after which the nanodomain can reposition within the PSD to a more stable location . In summary , due to the photostability of sQDs we have been able to characterize new details of AMPAR nanodomains and find that they are stable for significant times . \n With synaptic plasticity , the numbers of AMPARs in PSDs change . Even under basal conditions , the AMPARs are recycling and therefore constantly moving in and out of synaptic clefts and PSDs . AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis is very likely ongoing at synapses ( Greger and Esteban , 2007 ) and occurs at sites outside of spines ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ) or within spines away from PSDs ( Henley et al . , 2011 ) . Consequently , it is important to identify where highly mobile AMPA receptors are located . As we described above , currently the consensus viewpoint is that AMPARs enter PSDs from a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in the dendritic membrane , largely outside of the spine ( Figure 1a , beginning with route 1 ) . Other evidence indicates that the site of exocytosis is in the spine ( route 3 ) . In both cases , according to this data , a large mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs originates from sites in the membrane and then diffuses into the PSD ( route 2 ) . In this study , we find very little evidence for a sizeable pool of mobile extrasynaptic receptors in or around the spines . Most of the previous evidence in support of this AMPAR pool was from studies using super-resolution bQD-tagged AMPARs ( Opazo et al . , 2012; Giannone et al . , 2010; Nair et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , we too observe this behavior with bQDs ( Figure 3 ) . However , when using when AMPARs that are tagged by significantly smaller fluorophores\u2014sQDs or organic fluorophores ( Figures 4 and 5 ) \u2014they are overwhelmingly in the synapse:~84\u201397% of AMPA receptors were immobilized within PSDs and only 5\u201316% were freely diffusing in the dendrite membrane . Consequently , we believe that bQDs are too large to enable AMPARs to enter the synaptic cleft . We therefore believe that the previous results with bQDs have been misleading . Our results are consistent with studies using a variety of techniques that have found that AMPA receptors are largely localized to synapses and a relatively small extrasynaptic pool exists . First , electrophysiology has estimated the population of receptors in the synapses as well as in the dendrites . Cottrell et al . observed the density of AMPARs by measuring the glutamate-evoked response current through glutamate stimulating in synaptic regions or in dendrites . They observed the high current signal after glutamate stimulation in synaptic regions , but very low current signal with stimulation in extra-synaptic regions . Through comparing signal strength , they concluded that less than 1% of AMPA receptors were populated in the extra-synaptic regions after synaptogenesis by 11 days ( or more ) in vitro ( DIV ) ( Cottrell et al . , 2000 ) . Second , studies using fluorescence microscopy showed that AMPARs ( MacGillavry et al . , 2013 ) were co-localized with PSD-95 in dissociated cultured neurons , indicating that they were heavily colocalized with the synaptic regions . In addition , it was reported that AMPA receptors were mostly localized at the synaptic region in hippocampal neurons ( Passafaro et al . , 2001 ) . They observed that more than 75% of AMPA receptors , both subunits GluA1 and GluA2 , were colocalized with Shank at the synaptic regions . Also , their spatial and temporal fluorescence images showed that the exocytosed receptors accumulated over time ( ~30 min ) at the synaptic regions . Third , electron microscopy ( EM ) was used to show that AMPA receptors were localized at synapses ( Kharazia et al . , 1996 ) , although they could also exist in extrasynaptic domains ( Tao-Cheng et al . , 2011 ) , especially after synaptic excitation at exocytosis and\/or endocytosis sites . All these observations indicate that most AMPARs are localized and clustered at synaptic PSDs in mature neurons . The question arises as to why we observed so few highly-mobile extrasynaptic AMPARs . One possible reason is that in our protocol we have approximately 6 min of dead time with the addition of fluorophores and their binding to cell-surface AMPARs . It is likely many of the labeled AMPARs are diffusing into PSDs during the dead time and we do not observe them . Another possibility is that once AMPARs enter PSDs their residence time there is lengthy and we do not observe AMPARs exiting from PSDs because the rate of exit is much slower compared to the time period ( usually 50 s ) we use to monitor AMPAR dynamics . We also performed experiments where we compared bQD-tagged AMPARs to sQD-tagged AMPARs with and without removing the ECM ( Figure 6 ) . In this case , only the extrasynaptic bQD-tagged AMPARs , which are largely sterically hindered from entering PSDs , were affected . Previous studies found that ECM was acting as a diffusion barrier for extrasynaptic AMPARs during their membrane diffusion from extrasynaptic sites to entry into PSDs ( Frischknecht and Gundelfinger , 2012 ) . Our data is consistent with this conclusion and also supportive of our findings that show the different localization of bQD-tagged AMPARs and sQD-tagged AMPARs . The diffusion of sQD-tagged AMPARs was not affected by enzymatic removal of the ECM because they are almost all within the PSDs away from the effects of ECM removal . Diffusion of bQD-tagged AMPARs was significantly affected because they are largely highly mobile and extrasynaptic . Our findings on the bQD-tagged AMPARs are almost identical to the previous findings of others looking at the effects of ECM removal on bQD-tagged AMPARs ( Frischknecht et al . , 2009 ) . We conclude that the vast majority of AMPARs rapidly enter PSDs and are confined to sub-synaptic diffusion in nanodomains . The diffusion constant is about 10x slower than that of free extrasynaptic AMPARs . The AMPARs therefore do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously inferred in studies using AMPARs labeled with bQDs . In previous studies , the findings that AMPARs accumulate in a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in extra-synaptic dendritic membranes suggested that this AMPAR pool existed because of limits in the numbers of AMPARs that are stabilized within PSDs ( Opazo et al . , 2012 ) . According to Opazo et al . , AMPARs are not stabilized within PSDs until \u2018slots\u2019 , defined as PSD place-holders for AMPARs become free inside the PSD . Consequently , in this model , AMPARs build up outside of PSDs . We do not observe the highly mobile AMPAR pool when bQDs are replaced by a variety of smaller ( organic and sQDs ) fluorophores and linkers indicating that the highly mobile pool is an artifact of using bQDs attached to the AMPARs . Thus , the number of synaptic AMPARs does not appear to be limited by whether PSD slots are already occupied . The picture that emerges from our data is that after entry into PSDs , AMPARs are mobile but constrained within confined sub-synaptic nanodomains that are surprisingly stable , lasting for more than 15 min . It is likely that the AMPAR entry into PSDs is more rapid than the membrane diffusion rate to the PSDs . If this were not case , there would be accumulation of a mobile extra-synaptic pool , similar to what is observed when bQDs are attached to the AMPARs . The positioning of these nanodomains is likely critical for the AMPARs to receive glutamate from the presynaptic release sites ( Tang et al . , 2016; Jeyifous et al . , 2016 ) . Our conclusion that the number of synaptic AMPARs is not limited by whether PSD slots are occupied suggests that other factors regulate AMPAR numbers in PSDs . Potential candidates for what limits AMPAR numbers in PSDs are AMPAR exocytosis rate ( Figure 1a , route 1 ) , AMPAR endocytosis rate ( Figure 1a , route 3 ) and\/or barriers such as extracellular matrix ( Figure 6 ) that regulate AMPAR membrane diffusion on the membrane ( Figure 1a , route 2 ) . \n Experiments were performed with a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope with a Nikon APO 100 X objective ( N . A . 1 . 49 ) . The microscope stabilizes the sample in z-axis with the Perfect Focus System . An Agilent laser system MLC400B with four fiber-coupled lasers ( 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm and 640 nm ) was used for illumination . Elements software from Nikon was used for data acquisition . A back illuminated EMCCD ( Andor DU897 ) was used for recording . For 3-D imaging , a cylindrical lens ( CVI Melles Griot , SCX-25 . 4-5000 . 0- C-425-675 ) of 10 m focal length was inserted below the back aperture of the objective . A motorized stage from ASI with a Piezo top plate ( ASI PZ-2000FT ) was used for x-y-z position control . A quad-band dichroic ( Chroma , ZT405-488-561-640RPC ) was used and band-pass emission filter 525\/50 , 600\/50 , 710\/40 , 641\/75 was used for fluorescence imaging . Stage drift is a significant problem in taking super-resolution images . As we reported earlier ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) , making fiduciary-marked patterns on coverslips is a very efficient method to correct stage drift instead of using the previously favored fluorescent beads and gold nano-particles as fiduciary markers to correct stage drift . The perfectly stable fiduciary-marked patterns proved far superior to correct stage drift since it is impossible to perfectly immobilize beads or nano-particles on a coverslip surface , making it especially difficult to image live cells . More importantly , randomly spreading beads or nano-particles is a critical drawback for using them as fiduciary markers because it needs optimal number of fiduciary markers in the region of interest , whereas our fiduciary markers are a uniform pattern . Thus , the fluorescent beads and gold nanoparticles that have typically been used to correct stage drift are not effective , especially when imaging live cells . We have previously reported that mammalian cells can be stably cultured on fiduciary-marked coverslips without any other coating or treatment; however , although we had no problems taking super-resolution images of mammalian cells with this fiduciary pattern , we were not able to culture dissociated neurons on fiduciary-patterned coverslips . In general , poly- ( L\/D ) -lysine coating is necessary to culture dissociated neurons on glass coverslips because the cell membranes of neurons are negatively charged . Poly-lysine coating is not sufficient for neurons to adhere the fiduciary marker coverslips . We then employed laminin to coat coverslips . As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ( a ) , we first coated poly-lysine after treating coverslips in oxygen plasma and then applied an additional coating of laminin on the fiduciary-patterned coverslips . We found that dissociated neurons could be stably cultured on fiduciary-patterned coverslips after coating them with both poly-lysine and laminin , sequentially , as in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ( b ) . In terms of connection between neurons , we could obtain comparably good neurons on the fiduciary marked coverslip as we could culture them on the poly-lysine coated coverslip . More details to coat poly-lysine and laminin on the fiduciary marked coverslips were described in the method section . As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ( b\u2013d ) , once neurons have been stably cultured on fiduciary-patterned coverslips , they can then be successfully transfected . Furthermore , IR illumination , as shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ( b ) , is effective to allow clear observation of uniformly patterned fiduciary markers without affecting the visibility of fluorescence color channels . Hence , these coated fiduciary patterned coverslips are very useful to exclude stage drift , allowing for the culture , transfection , and super-resolution imaging and tracking of live neurons . Here , to demonstrate the method for taking super-resolution fluorescence images , neurons were transfected with two plasmids , one allowing expression of the post-synaptic protein homer1 with a photoactivable fluorescence protein , mGeos or mEOS3 . 2 , and the other allowing expression of glutamate receptors , AMPARs with AP tag to biotinylate . We then labeled the glutamate receptors using qdots conjugated with either streptavidin or anti-GFP nanobodies . As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ( c ) , at 530 nm\u00a0~\u00a0700 nm of emission in wavelength , we observed fluorescence from the proteins and receptors without any auto-fluorescence from the fiduciary pattern . We could clearly observe the fiduciary pattern in the IR channel and the live cells in the visible channels , as shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ( d ) . Fiduciary markers in the IR image are tracked , fitting the fiduciary markers using either the Gaussian or the Airy function . The IR camera electronically synchronizes with the visible camera so that the traces of fiduciary markers as recorded by the IR camera accurately calculates the stage drift at the time the cells are imaged . We can then correct the super-resolution cell images for stage drift accordingly . The fiduciary marker trace corresponds to the stage drift . Thus , through this post-processing , we can correct for stage drift . Since fiduciary markers are stationary , stage drift can be much more accurately calculated using them than when using more conventional existing methods of calculating stage drift with fluorescent beads or gold nano-particles . As shown in Figure 6 , using fiduciary markers , stage drift can be controlled within an error of around 1 nm for x and y and 15 nm for z . Another technical difficulty is chromatic aberration . The three-dimensional multi-color super-resolution imaging technique allows us to observe the interaction between two different species\/types of proteins or organelles in cells; however , the color shifts that occur in different color channels is a concern to take images can be even more pronounced and problematic in super resolution images different color channels . These color shifts will cause the images to be slightly different . Even though we observe exactly the same object at different color channels , the images will be a little mismatched in different color channels . Since the refractive index of light depends on its wavelength , this chromatic aberration causes focus on an object to be detected in a little different place in each color channel . This means that we have to correct this difference chromatic aberration for studying the interaction between different proteins or organelles when using multi-color super-resolution imaging . Most commercially available objective lenses are designed to optically minimize chromatic aberration . Based on our measurements , this optical design for objective lenses will corrects within the margin of error of about 100 nm; however , given that the spatial resolution of super-resolution microscopy is only about 20\u00a0~\u00a030 nm , a margin of the error of 100 nm is a significant error . This means that achromatic optical design is not sufficient to correct chromatic aberration , especially in super-resolution imaging . Using our method , chromatic aberration can be corrected within a margin of error of 2 nm . We accomplish this with as reported ( DeWitt et al . , 2012; Pertsinidis et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . In order to correct chromatic aberration , we made a nano-hole pattern on a silver- coated coverslip . Using a thermal evaporator , a glass coverslip is coated with silver at a thickness of about 100 nm using a thermal evaporator . The nanohole pattern is produced by fast ion beam ( FIB ) equipment , sputtering holes of about 100 nm in size every 1 . 5 \u03bcm . Holes are about 100 nm in diameter and are located every 1 . 5 \u03bcm . We took images for the nanoholes on three at the different color channels . As shown in supporting figure Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ( a\u2013d ) , the positions of the nanohole patterns are slightly different on each color channel . In Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ( d ) , the red and green spots are the nanoholes in the green channel and in one of two red channels , shown by zooming in on the image of the the overlaid two color images . The significantly different position of the two sets of nanohole patterns is a result of shows the positions of red and green spots are significantly different , which is caused by chromatic aberration . We measured the chromatic aberration between the green ( GFP ) 530\u00a0nm channel and red ( RFP ) 600\u00a0nm\u00a0channel and 705\u00a0nm\u00a0channels . As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) , the\u00a0average difference in the location of the nanoholes in between two the nanohole pattern on channels 530\u00a0nm and 600\u00a0nm is about 80 nanometers . We found a similar range for the difference between nanohole locations in any two of the three-color channels . This means that , when obtaining multi-color super-resolution images , the error of co-localizations of any two colors is expected possible to be at least approximately 80 nm . Furthermore , we also evaluated the validity of the mapping functions for 3D imaging . We obtained the mapping function at a focal point of z\u00a0=\u00a00 , focal point , with an error of 2 nm , and , as shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) , this mapping function can be applied is valid up to within z=\u00a0\u00b1400 nm with an error of only 4 nm . when the error is 2 nm at z\u00a0=\u00a00 . Actually , we obtained the mapping function at z=200 nm , 400 nm , 600 nm , and 800 nm and , as represented in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) , the error is a little smaller than when using the mapping function obtained at z\u00a0=\u00a00; however , since a 3 D super-resolution image using astigmatism is not discrete along the z axis , it is not easy to have mapping functions along the z axis . At focal points above 400 nm , the error dramatically increased . We obtained the mapping function at z\u00a0=\u00a0200 nm , 400 nm , 600 nm , and 800 nm , as represented in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ( e ) . At focal points above 400 nm , the error dramatically increased . Although the error is a little smaller at focal points higher on the z axis than when using the mapping function obtained at z=0 , we conclude that when getting 3D images using astigmatism , the mapping function at z=0 is accurate enough to correct chromatic aberration . This is because a 3 D super-resolution image using astigmatism is not discrete along the z axis . Hence , it would be too time consuming to try to obtain more accurate mapping functions all along the z axis . Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from E18 rats according to UIUC guidelines as previous described ( Cai et al . , 2014 ) with the following modifications . In brief , hippocampal tissues were dissociated in 3 mg\/mL protease and plated on 25 mm coverslips coated with 1 mg\/mL poly-l-lysine and laminin . Neurons were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in neurobasal media ( ThermoFisher , 21103049 ) with B-27 supplement ( GIBCO ) , 2 \u03bcM glutmax and 50 unit\/mL penicillin and 50 unit\/ml streptomycin . On 12\u201313 days in vitro ( DIV ) , neurons were co-transfected with Homer1c-mGeos ( 1 \u03bcg\/coverslip ) with GluA2-AP ( 1 \u03bcg\/coverslip ) and BirA-ER ( 1 \u03bcg\/coverslip ) , and Homer1c-mGeos ( 1 \u03bcg\/coverslip ) for AMPA receptors by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent . At 24\u00a0~\u00a072 hr after transfection , the coverslips were transferred to warm imaging buffer ( HBSS supplemented with 10 mM Hepes , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 . 2 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM D-glucose ) for 5 min incubation and mounted onto an imaging dish ( Warner RC-40LP ) . In the imaging dish , neurons were incubated in imaging buffer containing QDs and casein ( ~400 times dilution for bQDs , and\u00a0~80 times dilution for sQDs; stock solution purchased from Vector labs , SP-5020 ) for 5 min at 30\u00b0C and washed with 10 ml of imaging buffer . Finally , 3 mL of imaging buffer was added to the imaging dish that was subsequently mounted on the microscope . For ECM removal , we enzymatically removed the ECM using hyaluronidase ( HX0514 \u2013 Calbiochem , 100 units\/ml left overnight at 37\u00b0 with 5% CO2 ) . For labeling endogenous AMPARs using antibody , we conjugated Alexa647 NHS ester ( Thermo-Fisher: A37573 , Waltham , MA ) with anti-GluR2 ( Anti-Glutamate Receptor 2 Antibody , extracellular , clone 6C4: Sigma-Aldrich: MAB397 , St . Louis , MO ) To express mSA , E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS was transformed with an appropriate expression vector and plated on Luria Bertani ( LB ) agar containing ampicillin . Several colonies were selected from the plate for overnight growth at 37\u00b0C in an LB starter culture containing 200 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin . The following morning , the starter culture was diluted 100 fold into Terrific Broth ( TB ) containing 0 . 05% glucose , 0 . 5% glycerol , 0 . 2% \u03b1-lactose , 1 mM MgSO4 , 900 \u03bcM biotin , and 200 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin . The cells were grown at 37\u00b0C and 300 rpm until OD600 reached 0 . 3 , at which point the shaker temperature was reduced to 20\u00b0C . Once the culture has reached OD600=0 . 6 , IPTG was added to the final concentration of 75 \u03bcM and the shaker speed was increased to 375 rpm . After 24 hr induction at 20\u00b0C , cells were removed by centrifugation and the culture medium containing secreted mSA was collected for purification . The medium was sonicated with a 200 W sonicator ( 30 s on , 30 s off for 4 cycles at 50% amplitude capacity ) . The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7 . 5 using NaOH and imidazole was added to 10 mM . The medium was then centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 20 min to remove any precipitates . The clarified medium was passed through a column packed with Ni-NTA Superflow Agarose pre-equilibrated in PBS and 10 mM imidazole . The column was then washed with PBS and 20 mM imidazole . Finally , the bound protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in PBS . The eluted protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged to 100 mM glycine buffer pH 2 . 3 using a centrifugal filter to remove bound biotin . Finally , the sample was buffer exchanged to PBS . Yields were estimated based on A280 measurements and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining . All streptavidin homologs have a conserved three dimensional structure , but differences in the binding pocket residues lead to differences in biotin binding . For example , the main chain root mean squared deviation between mSA and streptavidin is 0 . 82 \u00c5 but there is\u00a0~105 fold difference in their binding affinities . Although extremely high affinity is not needed for labeling live cells , rapid dissociation of bound biotin interferes with detection and measurement because it results in loss of fluorescence intensity over time . As such , improving the dissociation kinetics ( i . e . slowing the off rate koff ) of mSA is important to develop a useful imaging reagent . We have previously demonstrated that replacing S25 with histidine reduces koff by 7 . 5 fold by blocking solvent entry into the binding pocket through steric hindrance ( Demonte et al . , 2013 ) . Keeping water molecules out of the binding pocket is important because they compete with mSA-biotin hydrogen bonds and lead to biotin dissociation . S25 is located in the loop between \u03b2\u2212strands 1 and 2 ( L1 , 2 ) , which is found at the subunit interface of streptavidin but is solvent exposed in mSA . Therefore , blocking solvent entry in mSA in part involves recreating the lost physical barrier near L1 , 2 . To improve the dissociation kinetics further , we modeled the binding pocket of mSA using high affinity dimer bradavidin II ( Brad2 ) , which binds biotin with Kd\u00a0<10\u221210 M ( Helppolainen et al . , 2008 ) . L1 , 2 and the binding loop L3 , 4 adopt nearly identical conformations in mSA and Brad2 , thus allowing key residues to be reliably modeled in mSA . The Brad2 residue corresponding to mSA S25 is R17 , which makes a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with G103 and D104 , respectively , to form a solvent barrier around L1 , 2 as shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ( a , b ) . Arginine is larger than serine and histidine and is therefore more effective in blocking solvent entry . To reconstruct the solvent barrier in mSA , we mutated S25 to R , and measured the dissociation rate of the mutant mSA using fluorescence polarization spectroscopy . The dissociation rate of mSA-S25R is slower than that of mSA or mSA-S25H . Brad2 also contains F42 in L3 , 4 to create a hydrophobic lid over bound biotin and trap the molecule in the binding pocket . Mutating F42 to alanine significantly reduces the affinity of interaction , indicating that the hydrophobic lid also plays an important role in biotin binding . We therefore introduced the corresponding mutation T48F in mSA-S25R to create a hydrophobic binding pocket and further reduce the dissociation rate . The measured koff of mSA-S25R\/T48F ( mSA-RF ) is 37 fold lower compared to original mSA , that\u00a0is . t\u00bd=402 min , and\u00a0~5 fold lower than the best mutant to date , thst\u00a0is mSA-S25H ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . The single point mutant mSA-T48F resulted in only limited improvement in biotin dissociation ( t\u00bd=13 min ) , indicating that the two mutations function cooperatively . We also tested an alternative design of the hydrophobic lid with a tryptophan , mSA-S25R\/T48W\/D124T ( or mSA-RWT ) , which had similarly slow dissociation kinetics , t\u00bd=330 min ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . Therefore , construction of solvent barriers through cooperative mutations in L1 , 2 and L3 , 4 can modulate the dissociation kinetics and improve the mSA-biotin interaction . To demonstrate the use of new engineered mSA in cell labeling , we expressed a biotin acceptor peptide ( AP ) fused to CFP and a transmembrane helix ( TM ) on the surface of HEK293 . We then added purified E . coli biotin ligase , BirA , to the cell culture to induce site-specific biotinylation of AP . The cells were fixed and labeled with mSA-RF\u2014EGFP for imaging by confocal microscopy . The CFP positive cells were selectively labeled , suggesting high specificity of interaction between mSA-RF and biotin ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d and e ) . Furthermore , the intensity of EGFP fluorescence remained high after 1 hr , indicating that the interaction is stable and mSA-RF remained stably bound during measurement . In order to verify whether SA-qdots were in fact cross-linking , we compared the diffusion coefficient of mSA-qdots and SA-qdots on the lipid bilayer at different concentrations ( 0 . 2% and 1 . 0% ) of biotinylated lipid molecules . If a qdot binds to one biotinylated lipid molecule , the resulting labeled lipid molecule will diffuse at the same rate as a free diffusion of a lipid molecule; whereas , if a qdot binds to multiple biotinylated lipid molecules , the diffusion rate will significantly slow down as shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 . We first determined whether there is any difference in the diffusion rate of molecules labeled in three ways: ( 1 ) those labeled with normal SA-qdot conjugates formed with big qdots ( one conjugate has many streptavidin and numerous binding site on SA-big qdots ) ; ( 2 ) those labeled with normal SA-qdot conjugates formed with small qdots ( one conjugate has four binding sites from the streptavidin ) ; and ( 3 ) those labeled with mSA-qdot conjugates using monomeric streptavidin and small qdots ( one conjugate has only one binding site ) . We hypothesized that normal streptavidin conjugates with both small and big qdots would be much more likely to bind multiple biotins than would be the case with mSA conjugates . We found this to be the case , as represented in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 . Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 shows that there was little difference in the diffusion rate of molecules labeled with normal SA-qdots , whether conjugated with small or big qdots: there were a large number of slow diffusive qdots for both normal streptavidin conjugates , indicating that they had cross-linked to multiple molecules , even at the 0 . 2% biotin concentration shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 . At 1 . 0% biotin , there was even a larger population of slow diffusive qdots , that\u00a0is , cross-linked qdots . By contrast , in the case of mSA qdot conjugates , we found that most qdot conjugates were freely diffusive at 0 . 2% as well as at 1 . 0% biotin concentration; that is , mSA-qdots do not show a slow diffusive population of labeled molecules at either 0 . 2% or 1 . 0% concentrations . These observations showed that normal streptavidin frequently cross-links to multiple molecules while monomeric streptavidin did not . In order to further examine cross-linking of normal and monomeric streptavidin , we compared the run length of kinesin ( K432 , biotin at C-terminus ) . It is well known that when the cargo ( in this case the streptavidin-qdot conjugate ) binds to multiple motor proteins , the cargo will be transported over a longer distance than when the cargo binds to a single motor protein . ( Beeg et al . , 2008; Furuta et al . , 2013 ) A single motor protein transports cargo approximately 1 um , while multiple motor proteins can walk farther than 1 um . Thus , if we compare the run length of kinesin using SA-qdots and mSA-qdots at different ratios of kinesin and qdots , then we can examine the possibility that one qdot is binding to multiple proteins versus binding to a single protein . For accuracy of labeling , we want to confirm that binding is to a single protein and a shorter kinesin run length will indicate this . In the case of mSA-qdots , we found the run length was the same as that of a single kinesin at a ratio of 2:1 ( two kinesin molecules to one qdot ) . As expected ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , the run length was not changed even when the ratio of kinesin to qdots was increased to 6:1 . This means that mSA-qdots do not bind to multiple motor proteins . By contrast , in the case of SA-qdots , the run length of kinesin was more than the typical run length of kinesin , as shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4 . Even at a ratio of 2:1 , the histogram of run lengths shows that some kinesin walked longer than the typical kinesin run length . At 6:1 , we found that the run length significantly increased , indicating cross-linking . These results mirror the results we obtained in our first experiment about diffusion rates of labeled molecules in the lipid bilayer . After focusing the sample in bright field , the Perfect Focus System was activated to minimize the sample drift in z direction . The samples were then scanned in the GFP channel ( 488 excitation , 525\/50 emission ) to locate transfected cells . A fluorescent image of the cells was taken for reference . To track the QD labeled receptors , 488 nm or 561 nm lasers was used for excitation in the hi-low-fluorescence mode with an appropriate band-pass filter for collecting the fluorescence . In terms of localization precision of fluorophores , as shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8 , organic dyes were about 11\u00a0~\u00a021 nm for x and y ( Atto647N \u2013 12 nm for both x and y ) and CF633- 21 nm for x and 12 nm for y ) and about 32 nm ( Atto 647N ) \/42 nm ( CF633 ) for z . Qdots were 9 . 6 nm for x , 8 . 2 nm for y , and 18 nm for z . After the tracking experiment , the PALM ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ) experiment was carried out on the same neurons . PALM was used for super-resolution of post-synaptic density . Post-synaptic protein Homer1c was used as the PSD marker and its C- terminus was fused to photoactivatable protein mGeos . A 100 ms 405 nm laser pulse was used to activate mGeos proteins from dark to green fluorescent state . The sample was then excited with a 488 nm read out laser and emission was collected with a 535\/50 band-pass filter . The cycle was repeated for 200\u2013300 times , collecting 4000\u20136000 frames . The z calibration was created following method described by Huang et al . ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) using fluorescent beads on a glass surface and applied to both tracking and PALM data . Cy3B-STORM was done following the procedure described on Joshua et al ( Vaughan et al . , 2012 ) . We labeled neurons with Cy3B-SA ( 2 \u03bcM ) following the procedure of sQD labeling . We then fixed the cells with a solution of 4% PFA and 0 . 1% Glutaraldehyde in HBSS for 10 min . Wash with three tines PBS . Treat the sample with 10 mM of NaBH4 in PBS freshly prepared for 10 min . Wash with PBS . Before imaging , we add imaging buffer consisting of 5 \u03bcL of PCD , 20 \u03bcL of PCA , 4 \u03bcL of Trolox in 471 \u03bcL of T-100 ( 100 mM Tris at pH 8 . 0 ) . Images were acquired at 10 Hz using 405 nm laser at low power to do activation and 561 nm laser to excite fluorescence . In order to image native AMPARs , we labeled AMPARs using Anti-GluA2-Alexa647 after fixation . For STORM imaging , we added imaging buffer consisting of 5 mM MEA ( Sigma: 30070 , St . Louis , MO ) solution ( ~pH 8 . 0 ) and additionally added 40 mM Sodium D\/L-lactate ( Sigma: 71720 , St . Louis , MO ) and EC-Oxyrase ( Sigma: SAE0010 , St . Louis , MO ) in PBS in order to improve the photo-stability . For the tracking data , centroids of the all the QDs were localized in all the frames and a map of all the places QDs visited were obtained . A Matlab code was used to recover the trajectories of the QDs . In brief , the code finds locations of QDs in time t , and searches for nearby QDs in time t+1 as the next point on the trajectory . In the 3-D single particle tracking experiment , the maximum displacement of a QD in one time step is set to be 1 \u03bcm . The trajectory range was obtained by calculating the range of the trajectory in the x- , y- , and z- direction , and using the maximum of the three parameters . The diffusion coefficients from the trajectories were calculated in Matlab by fitting the first 4 points of mean-square-displacement curve . For the PALM data , positions of proteins detected in each frame are localized , cluster analysis was used for identify synapses . To determine if a trajectory was synaptic , the centers of synapses were determined , and trajectories within 2 \u03bcm radius of each synapse were identified . For each of these trajectories , the average distance was calculated between the center of the nearest synapse and all points on the trajectory . Any trajectories with an average distance smaller than 0 . 55 \u03bcm were considered synaptic . The visualizations of post-synaptic densities and sQD labeled AMPA\/NMDA receptor tracking trajectories were created using VMD 1 . 9 . 2 ( Humphrey et al . , 1996 ) , a widely-used program for visualizing and analyzing macromolecular structures and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation trajectories . VMD is optimized for dealing with large data sets containing millions of particles and thousands of trajectory frames , as encountered in the current study .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods"],"keywords":["structural biology and molecular biophysics","neuroscience"],"id":"elife-27744-v3"}
{"lay_summary":"Cells contain a large number of proteins that control the activity of genes in response to various signals and changes in their environment . Often these proteins work together in groups called complexes . In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , one of these complexes is called DOMINO . The DOMINO complex alters gene activity by interacting with other proteins called histones which influence how the genes are packaged and accessed within the cell . DOMINO works in two separate ways . First , it can replace certain histones with other variants that regulate genes differently . Second , it can modify histones by adding a chemical marker to them , which alters how they interact with genes . It was not clear how DOMINO can do both of these things and how that is controlled; but it was known that cells can make two different forms of the central component of the complex , called DOM-A and DOM-B , which are both encoded by the same gene . Scacchetti et al . have now studied fruit flies to understand the activities of these forms . This revealed that they do have different roles and that gene activity in cells changes if either one is lost . The two forms operate as part complexes with different compositions and only DOM-A includes the TIP60 enzyme that is needed to modify histones . As such , it seems that DOM-B primarily replaces histones with variant forms , while DOM-A modifies existing histones . This means that each form has a unique role associated with each of the two known behaviors of this complex . The presence of two different DOMINO complexes is common to flies and , probably , other insects . Yet , in other living things , such as mammals and yeast , their two roles are carried out by protein complexes originating from two distinct genes . This illustrates a concept called convergent evolution , where different organisms find different solutions for the same problem . As such , these findings provide an insight into the challenges encountered through evolution and the diverse solutions that have developed . They will also help us to understand the ways in which protein activities can adapt to different needs over evolutionary time .","article":"Histone acetylation and deposition of H2A . Z variant are integral aspects of active transcription . In Drosophila , the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism . Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase , DOM-A and DOM-B , directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes . Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms . The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A . V ( the fly ortholog of H2A . Z ) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner , like the yeast SWR1 complex . The DOM-A complex , instead , functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4 , targeting lysine 12 of histone H4 . Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation . In yeast and humans , nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification . Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene . \n Nucleosomes , the fundamental units of chromatin , are inherently stable and organized in polymeric fibers of variable compactness ( Baldi et al . , 2018; Erdel and Rippe , 2018 ) . The dynamic properties of the fiber required for gene regulation are implemented by several broad principles . ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors slide or evict nucleosomes ( Clapier et al . , 2017 ) , chemical modifications of histones create new interaction surfaces ( Bowman and Poirier , 2015; Zhao and Garcia , 2015 ) and histone variants furnish nucleosomes with special features ( Talbert and Henikoff , 2017 ) . The very conserved H2A variant H2A . Z accounts for\u00a0~5\u201310% of the total H2A-type histone pool in vertebrates ( Redon et al . , 2002; Thatcher and Gorovsky , 1994 ) and flies ( Bonnet et al . , 2019 ) . H2A . Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers , where it is thought to be important to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation ( Adam et al . , 2001; Weber et al . , 2010; Weber et al . , 2014 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , H2A . Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1 . C ) , a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core ( Mizuguchi et al . , 2004; Ranjan et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2018a; Willhoft et al . , 2018; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . In humans , the two SWR1 orthologs EP400 and SRCAP may also be involved in H2A . Z incorporation ( Greenberg et al . , 2019; Pradhan et al . , 2016 ) . In\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0melanogaster , where H2A . Z is named H2A . V ( Baldi and Becker , 2013; van Daal and Elgin , 1992 ) , only one gene codes for a SWR1 ortholog: domino ( dom ) ( Ruhf et al . , 2001 ) . The first biochemical characterization revealed the presence of a multi-subunit complex composed of 15 proteins associated with the DOM ATPase ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . While many of the interactors identified are orthologous to the yeast SWR1 . C subunits , additional interactors were found . Surprisingly , they showed similarity to components of a distinct yeast complex , the Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 ( NuA4 . C ) ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . NuA4 . C is a histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) complex with the histone H4 N-terminal domain as a primary target ( Allard et al . , 1999; Doyon et al . , 2004; Wang et al . , 2018a; Xu et al . , 2016 ) . The DOM complex ( DOM . C ) appeared then to be a chimera , a fusion between two complexes with different biochemical activities . It has been proposed that both enzymatic activities of DOM . C , histone acetylation and histone variant exchange , are required for H2A . V turnover during DNA damage response ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . It is unclear , however , if this model of DOM . C action could be generalized to other processes , such as transcription regulation . Furthermore , it is still not known how H2A . V is incorporated globally into chromosomes while , at the same time , enriched at promoters . It is long known that the dom transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate two major isoforms , DOM-A and DOM-B ( Ruhf et al . , 2001 ) . We and others previously found that the two splice variants play non-redundant , essential roles during development with interesting phenotypic differences ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016; Liu et al . , 2019 ) . In this work , we systematically characterized the molecular context and function of each DOM splice variant in D . melanogaster cell lines and assessed their contribution to the activity of the DOM . C in the context of transcription . We discovered the existence of two separate , isoform-specific complexes with characteristic composition . Both are involved in transcription regulation , but through different mechanisms . On the one hand , we found that the DOM-B . C is the main ATP-dependent remodeler for H2A . V , responsible for its deposition across the genome and specifically at active promoters . On the other hand , we discovered that DOM-A . C is not involved in bulk H2A . V incorporation , despite the presence of an ATPase domain and many shared subunits with DOM-B . C . Rather , we realized that DOM-A . C might be the \u2018missing\u2019 acetyltransferase NuA4 . C of D . melanogaster , which specifically targets lysine 12 of histone H4 ( H4K12 ) , the most abundant and yet uncharacterized H4 acetylation in flies ( Feller et al . , 2015 ) . Surprisingly , our data also suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A . C , a principle that might be conserved across metazoans . Our work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators . \n The isoforms of the DOMINO ATPase , DOM-A and DOM-B , are identical for the first 2008 amino acids , but alternative splicing diversifies their C-termini ( Figure 1A ) . Both proteins share an N-terminal HSA domain and a central , INO80-like ATPase domain . DOM-A has a longer C-terminus characterized by a SANT domain and a region rich in poly-glutamine stretches ( Q-rich ) . The shorter C-terminus of DOM-B , instead , folds in no predictable manner . Given these differences , we wondered if the interaction partners of the two isoforms might differ . To avoid artefactual association of DOM isoforms with proteins upon overexpression , we inserted a 3XFLAG tag within the endogenous dom gene in D . melanogaster embryonic cell lines using CRISPR\/Cas9 . The sites were chosen such that either DOM-A ( DOM-RA ) or DOM-B ( DOM-RE ) would be tagged at their C-termini . Of note , the editing of DOM-A C-terminus results in the additional tagging of a longer , DOM-A-like isoform ( DOM-RG , which compared to DOM-RA has an insertion of 35 residues at its N-terminus starting from residue 401 ) , but leaves a second DOM-A-like isoform untagged ( DOM-RD , 16 residues shorter than DOM-RA at the very C-terminus ) . We obtained three different clonal cell lines for each isoform ( 3 homozygous clones for DOM-A , 2 homozygous and 1 heterozygous clone for DOM-B ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . The dom gene editing resulted in the expression of 3XFLAG-tagged proteins of the correct size and with similar expression levels across clones ( Figure 1B ) . To identify the strongest and most stable interactors , we enriched the isoforms and associated proteins from nuclear extracts by FLAG-affinity chromatography under very stringent conditions . Mass-spectrometry analysis revealed 13 and 12 strongly enriched interactors ( FDR\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 and log2 fold-change\u00a0>0 ) for DOM-A and DOM-B , respectively ( Figure 1C , Supplementary file 1 ) . Of those , 7 are common between the two isoforms and were previously characterized as DOM interactors ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . Two of the expected subunits , PONT and REPT , associated more strongly with DOM-B than with DOM-A under these conditions ( log2 DOM-A IP\/CTRL\u00a0=\u00a01 . 19 and 1 . 16 , FDR\u00a0=\u00a00 . 373 and 0 . 338 ) . A newly identified DOM-B interactor , HCF , also interacts less strongly DOM-A ( log2 DOM-A IP\/CTRL\u00a0=\u00a00 . 70 , FDR\u00a0=\u00a00 . 466 ) . The unique interactors revealed interesting differences between DOM-A and DOM-B ( Figure 1D ) . Three of the proteins that specifically associate with DOM-A [ING3 , E ( Pc ) and TIP60] share extensive homology with the acetyltransferase module of the yeast NuA4 complex . Another component of the yeast NuA4 . C , NIPPED-A , specifically associates with DOM-A . Additionally , we found two transcription factors , XBP1 and CG12054 , amongst the DOM-A specific interactors . On the DOM-B side , only ARP6 and PPS appear to\u00a0be\u00a0specific interactors of this isoform . While ARP6 was not described before in Drosophila , its yeast homolog is essential for H2A . Z remodeling by the SWR1 . C ( Wu et al . , 2005 ) . To validate the DOM-A\/TIP60 interaction , we raised monoclonal antibodies against TIP60 . Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that TIP60 interacts with DOM-A and not with DOM-B ( Figure 1E and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . The immunoprecipitation of DOM-A appears to be more efficient when probing with the anti-FLAG antibody compared to the anti-DOM-A polyclonal antibody . This difference might be explained by the presence of one of the DOM-A-like isoforms ( DOM-RD ) , which was left untagged . This isoform is therefore not immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody , but it is recognized by the DOM-A specific antibody . Importantly , the same co-immunoprecipitation showed that DOM-A and DOM-B do not interact with each other under these conditions . Taken together , these findings document the existence of two distinct DOM complexes: DOM-A . C and DOM-B . C . Previous observation in flies suggested that DOM-A and DOM-B have different , non-redundant functions during Drosophila development ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016; Ruhf et al . , 2001 ) . Isoform-specific depletion by RNA interference ( RNAi ) of either DOM variant in a Drosophila embryonic cell line did not lead to depletion of the other isoform ( Figure 2A ) . Interestingly , knock-down of DOM-A ( but not DOM-B ) led to a strong reduction of TIP60 protein levels . tip60 mRNA levels were unchanged ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , indicating that TIP60 requires DOM-A for stability ( Figure 2A ) . This suggests that most of TIP60 resides in the DOM-A complex in Drosophila cells . The yeast SWR-1 and NuA4 complexes are both implicated in transcription ( Morillo-Huesca et al . , 2010; Searle et al . , 2017 ) . We therefore explored the functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription by RNAseq . In our analysis , we also included knock-downs of H2A . V and TIP60 . Knock-down of either DOM-A , DOM-B , TIP60 or H2A . V individually resulted in significant perturbation of transcription , with notable differences ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B , Supplementary file 2 ) . Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) revealed clearly different transcriptional responses upon loss of DOM-A or DOM-B ( Figure 2B ) , which can be visualized by comparing their log2 fold-changes relative to control ( Figure 2C ) . The correlation value of 0 . 45 indicates that many genes are regulated similarly by both ATPases , but a significant number of genes are also differentially affected upon specific depletion of either DOM-A or DOM-B ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . As expected , the transcriptional effects of DOM-A knock-down , but not of DOM-B , resemble the ones caused by knock-down of TIP60 ( Figure 2B , D ) . Depletion of H2A . V led to a global reduction of transcription , only observable by normalization to spiked-in D . virilis RNA ( see methods ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . The effects of H2A . V depletion were better correlated to DOM-B ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 51 ) than to DOM-A knock-down ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 25 ) ( Figure 2B , D ) . Many effects of DOM-B depletion may be explained by its H2A . V deposition function , but the ATPase also affects transcription through different routes . In summary , we found that the depletion of the two DOM isoforms in cells caused specific transcriptional perturbations . The partially overlapping responses upon DOM-B and H2A . V depletions motivated a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between DOM-B and H2A . V levels in the genome . Both SWR1-type ATPases , DOM-A and DOM-B may contribute to H2A . V incorporation and turnover . We explored global changes in H2A . V levels upon isoform-specific RNAi in nuclear extracts containing chromatin and soluble nuclear proteins . We found a strong H2A . V reduction upon DOM-B depletion ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , while H2A . V mRNA level was unchanged ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Among the interactors found in our mass-spectrometry analysis , only RNAi against the DOM-B . C-specific subunit ARP6 reduced H2A . V levels to a similar extent ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . H2A . V was not affected by the knock-down of DOM-A , TIP60 or other DOM-A . C-specific subunits ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , C , D ) . While western blots reveal global changes , they are not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes of H2A . V occupancy at specific sites in chromatin . We therefore employed a more sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP-seq ) approach , in which we included D . virilis spike-in cells to quantify global changes in H2A . V levels . As expected , we scored dramatic effects on H2A . V levels along the entire genome upon depletion of DOM-B , including promoters and transcriptional termination sites ( Figure 3B , C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Depletion of DOM-A did not affect chromosomal H2A . V at any of these sites ( Figure 3B , C ) . These observations support the notion that the DOM-B . C , and not the DOM-A . C , is the remodeler dedicated to H2A . V incorporation . Since SWR1-type remodelers bind and hydrolyze ATP to incorporate H2A . Z variants ( Hong et al . , 2014; Willhoft et al . , 2018 ) , we wanted to confirm the ATP-requirement for in vivo incorporation of H2A . V by DOM-B . We devised an RNAi-based complementation strategy in which we rescued the effects of depleting endogenous dom-B mRNA by expression of RNAi-resistant dom-B transgenes . The functional complementation involved wild-type DOM-B or a mutant predicted to be deficient in ATP-binding ( K945G ) ( Hong et al . , 2014; Mizuguchi et al . , 2004; Figure 3D ) . GFP-tagging of the DOM-B proteins allowed to selectively monitor the H2A . V levels by immunofluorescence microscopy in the cells in which the transgenes are expressed . We detected higher levels of H2A . V in cells complemented with a wild-type DOM-B transgene , indicating the expected rescue ( Figure 3E ) . Conversely , the remodeling-defective mutant transgene did not increase the residual H2A . V levels ( Figure 3F ) . Comparing the mean H2A . V signal between cells that express the transgene ( GFP+ ) and cells that don\u2019t ( GFP- ) , revealed once more that only the wild-type could restore H2A . V levels ( Figure 3G , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . The data suggest that the DOM-B . C is responsible for the incorporation of H2A . V in an ATP-dependent manner . Despite the presence of an ATPase domain identical to DOM-B , DOM-A does not seem to be responsible for H2A . V incorporation in steady state . Therefore , we considered other functions for DOM-A . C . The striking correlation between transcriptional responses upon TIP60 and DOM-A depletion suggests a unique association with functional relevance . Our mass-spectrometry analysis had identified several proteins that are homologous to corresponding subunits of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex . The core NuA4 . C subunit EAF1 is a small protein with prominent N-terminal HSA and C-terminal SANT domains . DOM-A also features similarly arranged domains , but they are separated by the long ATPase domain ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . This raises the question whether DOM-A might serve as the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in Drosophila . The existence of such a complex with functional and structural similarity to the well-studied yeast complex has not been reported so far . Since NuA4 . C is responsible for histone acetylation , we looked at H3 and H4 acetylation changes upon DOM isoform-specific knock-down by targeted mass-spectrometry . The hypothesis of a Drosophila NuA4 . C poses the acetyltransferase TIP60 as the main effector of DOM-A . C . This is supported by the earlier finding that TIP60 is unstable in the absence of DOM-A ( Figure 2A ) . We therefore included TIP60 knock-down for our targeted mass-spectrometry . Our analysis showed that RNAi against DOM-A , but not against DOM-B , specifically reduces H4K12ac ( average 28 . 9% reduction ) and , to a lesser extent , H4K5ac ( average 23 . 1% reduction ) ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Importantly , unsupervised clustering shows that depleting DOM-A or TIP60 lead to very similar changes in histone acetylation patterns: depletion of TIP60 also reduces H4K12ac , by on average 36 . 3% and H4K5ac by 16 . 4% ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Interestingly , we detected a decrease in monomethylation and increase of trimethylation at H3K27 by DOM depletion , a bit stronger for DOM-A or TIP60 ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . H4 methylation was unchanged ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . The H4K12 seems to be the most prominent chromatin target of the DOM-A\/TIP60 complex . We sought to confirm the mass spectrometric result by an orthogonal ChIP-seq experiment . We found the H4K12ac signal reduced in many regions of the genome , including promoters and transcriptional termination sites , upon TIP60 RNAi and to a lesser extent upon DOM-A RNAi ( Figure 4B , C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F , H , I ) , but the results suffer from variability , probably due to a low ChIP efficiency of the H4K12ac antibody ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . Comparison between H4K12ac and transcription showed that genes downregulated in DOM-A or TIP60 knock-down tend to have higher basal levels of H4K12ac at promoters ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . The reduction of H4K12ac by DOM-A or TIP60 knock-down , however , is global and does not affect some genes specifically ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H ) . Remarkably , depletion of DOM-B caused an unexpected increase in H4K12 acetylation at many chromosomal regions that lose the mark upon DOM-A ablation ( Figure 4B , C ) . Depletion of H2A . V also causes a small H4K12ac increase similarly to DOM-B knock-down , as if the absence of this remodeler and\/or its substrate allowed more DOM-A activity at promoters . The yeast NuA4 . C does not contain a functional ATPase at its core . To explore whether the acetylation of H4K12 catalyzed by the DOM-A . C depends on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity , we employed the same RNAi-based complementation strategy we had used for DOM-B ( Figure 3D ) . DOM-A was depleted and RNAi-resistant DOM-A wild-type or ATPase mutant derivatives were tested for their ability to rescue the loss of H4K12ac . As expected , the wild-type DOM-A transgene restored H4K12 acetylation ( Figure 4D ) . Remarkably , this acetylation did not depend on a functional DOM-A ATPase . Comparison of the mean H4K12ac signals in cells that do or do not express the transgene confirmed that both , the wild-type and the mutant transgenes , could restore H4K12ac levels ( Figure 4E , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1J ) . \n Our mass-spectrometry analysis of endogenously expressed DOM isoforms purified under stringent conditions revealed two separate complexes . A DOM . C was previously reported after overexpression and affinity-purification of tagged PONTIN ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) , which yielded a mixture of DOM-A and DOM-B complexes and may be contaminated with the dINO80 complex , which also contains PONTIN ( Klymenko et al . , 2006 ) . In light of our results , we think the model for H2A . V exchange during DNA damage response proposed in this early work ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) should be re-visited accounting for the contribution of both DOM-A . C , DOM-B . C and possibly dINO80 . C . It will be interesting to define the role of each complex on the recognition and restoration of damaged chromatin , especially at the level of H2A . V remodeling and acetylation-based signaling . We previously showed that DOM-B , and not DOM-A or TIP60 , affects H2A . V levels during fly oogenesis ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016 ) . In addition to confirming this finding in a different system and with complementary experimental approaches , we now also showed that the DOM-B . C is responsible for H2A . V incorporation into chromatin . The reaction requires ATP , like SWR1 . C-mediated H2A . Z incorporation . We also discovered a previously unidentified subunit , ARP6 , which is necessary for the maintenance of H2A . V global levels , just like DOM-B . In yeast SWR1 . C and human SRCAP . C , the ARP6 orthologs are indispensable for nucleosome remodeling since they couple the ATPase motor to productive nucleosome sliding ( Matsuda et al . , 2010; Willhoft et al . , 2018; Willhoft and Wigley , 2020; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . The Drosophila DOM-B . C is likely to employ a similar remodeling mechanism . Knock-down of DOM-B affects transcription , but the effects overlap only partially with those that follow H2A . V depletion . This discrepancy could be explained in several ways . First , the reduction of H2A . V levels upon DOM-B knock-down is not as extensive as the one caused by direct depletion of H2A . V . The residual levels of H2A . V upon DOM-B depletion may suffice to regulate transcription at many promoters . Second , we cannot exclude that DOM-B . C also impacts transcription independently of H2A . V incorporation . Third , the global increase of H4K12ac at promoters upon DOM-B knock-down might indirectly compensate for the loss of H2A . V at some specific genes . The DOM-A . C , surprisingly , did not affect H2A . V incorporation under physiological conditions in any of our assays , in agreement with what has been observed for the DOM-A isoform during oogenesis ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016 ) . DOM-A . C lacks the ARP6 subunit that is a mechanistic requirement for nucleosome remodeling by INO80-type remodelers ( Willhoft and Wigley , 2020 ) . Because the ATPase domain of DOM-A is identical to the one in DOM-B , it is possible that DOM-A utilizes ATP under circumstances that we did not monitor in our study . It is also possible that DOM-A . C-specific subunits have an inhibitory effect on DOM-A ATPase activity through allosteric regulation . Of note , the recombinant human ortholog of DOM-A , EP400 , can incorporate H2A . Z ( Park et al . , 2010 ) , but H2A . Z levels are unaffected if EP400 is depleted in vivo , where it resides in a multi-subunit complex ( Pradhan et al . , 2016 ) . Regulation of nucleosome remodeling through autoinhibitory domains or associated subunits is a widespread mechanism ( Clapier et al . , 2017 ) . Our data suggest that the DOM-A . C is the functional equivalent of the yeast NuA4 . C , which acetylates the H4 N-terminus ( Kuo et al . , 2015 ) and possibly other proteins . Depletion of DOM-A . C causes a significant reduction of H4K12ac at a global level . Some genomic regions that still retain a high H4K12ac ChIP signal in the absence of DOM-A may be explained by the presence of additional acetyltransferases targeting H4K12 , such as CHAMEAU ( Feller et al . , 2015; Peleg et al . , 2016 ) . The function of H4K12ac is still largely unknown in Drosophila , although it has been implicated in aging ( Peleg et al . , 2016 ) . We speculate that H4K12ac may participate in transcriptional regulation since knock-down of DOM-A or TIP60 perturb the transcriptional program in a very similar manner . Genes down-regulated upon DOM-A and TIP60 RNAi show high H4K12ac around their TSS , but the H4K12ac is not specifically reduced at their promoters . We speculate that these genes might rely more on H4K12ac for their expression or be more sensitive to changes in acetylation . Given that H4K12ac is the most abundant H4 acetylation ( Feller et al . , 2015; Peleg et al . , 2016 ) , we also cannot exclude that some of these effects are due to global and aberrant chromosomal condensation . The increase in H4K12ac at promoter observed upon DOM-B RNAi appears to be partially phenocopied by the knock-down of H2A . V . It is possible that H2A-containing nucleosomes are a better substrate for the DOM-A . C compared to the ones containing only H2A . V . The loss of the variant might therefore result in higher H4K12ac catalyzed by TIP60 . In the absence of DOM-A , TIP60 is unstable suggesting that the DOM-A . C is the major form of TIP60 , at least in D . melanogaster cells . It also suggests that during evolution a HAT module and some components of the SWR1 . C became stably associated in a new functional complex , the dNuA4 . C , as it\u00a0has been proposed for the human EP400 complex ( Auger et al . , 2008 ) . An intermediate case is found in C . albicans , where acetylation of EAF1 by TIP60 mediates a reversible association between the NuA4 . C and SWR1 . C ( Wang et al . , 2018b ) . We found that the DOM-A . C H4K12 HAT activity does not need the DOM-A ATPase activity . In yeast , inserting the ATPase domain of the Drosophila DOM between the HSA and SANT domains of EAF1 , the central subunit of the yeast NuA4 , does not affect its function ( Auger et al . , 2008 ) . Such a situation could also apply to DOM-A . Lastly , our mass-spectrometry analysis revealed new , uncharacterized interactors for DOM-A . Of those , the transcription factor CG12054 has been found as a potential DOM partner in a previous screen ( Rhee et al . , 2014 ) . Its human ortholog , JAZF1 , appears to be involved in transcriptional repression ( Nakajima et al . , 2004 ) and has been associated to endometrial stromal tumors ( Koontz et al . , 2001 ) . Its function in flies is unknown . Division of labor between chromatin modifying enzymes is key to ensure efficient regulation of nuclear processes . During evolution , genome duplications and genetic divergence expand and diversify activities . The case of DOM illustrates beautifully how evolution can take different routes to achieve what must be assumed as an important functional specification ( Figure 4F , Supplementary file 3 ) . In yeast , the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are entirely separate entities . In humans , whose genomes underwent duplication events , the paralogous SRCAP and EP400 protein ATPases each organize different complexes that may serve distinct , conserved functions . In Drosophila a similar specialization was achieved by alternative splicing . Surprisingly , the gene orthologs of dom in honeybee ( A . mellifera , LOC413341 ) , jewel wasp ( N . vitripennis , LOC100115939 ) , Jerdon\u2019s jumpin ant ( H . saltator , LOC105183375 ) , red flour beetle ( T . castaneum , LOC656538 ) and even in the common house spider ( P . tepidariorum , LOC107448208 ) undergo alternative splicing to generate at least two isoforms with different C-termini . The mode of specification of SWR1 and NuA4 through splice variants might therefore not be limited to Drosophila , but more wide-spread throughout the Arthropoda phylum . \n D . melanogaster embryonic Kc167 cell line was obtained from the\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0Genomic Resource Center ( https:\/\/dgrc . bio . indiana . edu\/Home ) . D . melanogaster S2 ( subclone L2-4 ) cell line was a kind gift of P Heun ( Villa et al . , 2016 ) . D . virilis 79f7Dv3 cell line was a kind gift of BV Adrianov ( Albig et al . , 2019 ) . The identity of cell lines was verified by high-throughput sequencing . Cells were subjected to mycoplasma testing . Cells were maintained at 26\u00b0C in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila Medium ( Thermo-Fischer , Cat . No 21720024 ) supplemented with 10% FBS ( Kc167 and S2 ) or 5% FBS ( 79f7Dv3 ) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat No P-4333 ) . gRNAs targeting exon 14 ( DOM-A and DOM-G , Flybase transcripts dom-RA and dom-RG ) or exon 11 ( DOM-B , Flybase transcript dom-RE ) were initially designed using GPP sgRNA designer ( https:\/\/portals . broadinstitute . org\/gpp\/public\/analysis-tools\/sgrna-design; Doench et al . , 2016 ) . gRNA candidates were checked for off-targets using flyCRISPR Target Finder ( https:\/\/flycrispr . org\/target-finder\/ , guide length\u00a0=\u00a020 , Stringency\u00a0=\u00a0high , PAM\u00a0=\u00a0NGG only ) ( Gratz et al . , 2014 ) . Two gRNAs each for DOM-A and DOM-B were selected ( Supplementary file 4 ) . The 20 bp gRNAs were fused to a tracrRNA backbone during synthesis and cloned downstream of the Drosophila U6 promoter . These constructs were synthesized as gBlocks ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) and PCR-amplified before transfection using Q5 polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Cat No . M0491S ) . To generate the repair template , the sequence encoding for 3XFLAG tag , including a stop codon , was inserted between two homology arms of 200 bp each by gene synthesis ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) ( Supplementary file 4 ) . The repair templates were cloned in pUC19 to generate repair plasmids . For CRISPR editing , one million S2 cells ( subclone L2-4 ) in 500 \u00b5L medium were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate . After 4 hr , cells were transfected with 110 ng of gRNAs ( 55 ng each ) , 200 ng of repair plasmid and 190 ng of pIB_Cas9_Blast ( encoding SpCas9 and carrying Blasticidin resistance , kind gift of P Heun ) using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent ( Roche , Cat . No 6366236001 ) . 24 hr after transfection , medium was replaced with 500 \u00b5L of fresh medium containing 25 \u00b5g\/ml Blasticidin ( Gibco , Cat . No A1113903 ) . Three days after selection the cells were collected and seeded into 6 cm tissue culture dishes at three different concentrations ( 1000 , 2000 and 5000 cells\/well ) and allowed to attach for 1\u20132 hr . Medium was then removed and cells carefully overlaid with 2 . 5 mL of a 1:1 mix of 2X Schneider\u2019s Medium ( prepared from powder , Serva , Cat . No 35500 ) + 20% FBS + 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin and 0 . 4% low-melting agarose equilibrated to 37\u00b0C . The dishes were sealed with parafilm , inserted into 15 cm dishes together with a piece of damp paper and sealed once more with parafilm . After 2 to 3 weeks , individual cell colonies were picked using a pipet , suspended in 100 \u00b5L of Schneider\u2019s Drosophila Medium + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin and plated into 96-well plates . Clones were expanded for 1\u20132 weeks and further expanded into 48-well plates . For PCR-testing of clones , 50 \u00b5L of cells were collected , 50 \u00b5L water was added and DNA was purified using Nucleospin Gel and PCR Cleanup ( Macherey-Nagel , Cat . No 740609 . 250 ) . Extracted DNA was PCR-amplified to check the insertion of the 3XFLAG tag . The PCR product of DOM-A clone #2 results larger due to the presence of an insertion 29 bp downstream of the stop codon ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Selected clones were further expanded and stored in liquid nitrogen in 90% FBS + 10% DMSO . For nuclear extraction from 3XFLAG-tagged cells lines , 0 . 5\u20131 billion cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min . Cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS , resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold NBT-10 buffer [15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 15 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 , 10% Sucrose , 0 . 15% Triton-X-100 , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ( Roche , Cat . No 5056489001 ) ] and rotated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . Lysed cells were gently overlaid on 20 ml of ice-cold NB-1 . 2 buffer ( 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 15 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 , 1 . 2 M Sucrose , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ) and spun at 4000 g for 15 min .

{"lay_summary":"The Ras family of proteins play an important role in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of the cell . Ras proteins are attached by a fatty tail to the inner surface of the cell membrane . When activated they transmit a burst of signal that controls critical behaviors like growth , survival and movement . It has been suggested that to prevent these signals from being accidently activated , Ras molecules must group together at specialized sites within the membrane before passing on their message . However , visualizing how Ras molecules cluster together at these domains has thus far been challenging . As a result , little is known about where these sites are located and how Ras molecules come to a stop at these domains . Now , Lee et al . have combined two microscopy techniques called \u2018single-particle tracking\u2019 and \u2018photoactivated localization microscopy' to track how individual molecules of activated Ras move in human cells grown in the lab . This revealed that Ras molecules quickly diffuse along the inside of the membrane until they arrive at certain locations that cause them to halt . However , computer models consisting of just the \u2018fast\u2019 and \u2018immobile\u2019 state could not correctly re-capture the way Ras molecules moved along the membrane . Lee et al . found that for these models to mimic the movement of Ras , a third \u2018intermediate\u2019 state of Ras mobility needed to be included . To investigate this further , Lee et al . created a fluorescent map that overlaid all the individual paths taken by each Ras molecule . The map showed regions in the membrane where the Ras molecules had stopped and possibly clustered together . Each of these \u2018immobilization domains\u2019 were then surrounded by an \u2018intermediate domain\u2019 where Ras molecules had begun to slow down their movement . Although the intermediate domains did not last long , they seemed to guide Ras molecules into the immobilization domains where they could cluster together with other molecules . From there , the cell constantly removed Ras molecules from these membrane domains and returned them back to their \u2018fast\u2019 diffusing state . Mutations in Ras proteins occur in around a third of all cancers , so a better understanding of their dynamics could help with future drug discovery . The methods used here could also be used to investigate the movement of other signaling molecules .","article":"Membrane nanodomains have been implicated in Ras signaling , but what these domains are and how they interact with Ras remain obscure . Here , using single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy ( spt-PALM ) and detailed trajectory analysis , we show that distinct membrane domains dictate KRasG12D ( an active KRas mutant ) diffusion and trafficking in U2OS cells . KRasG12D exhibits an immobile state in ~70 nm domains , each embedded in a larger domain ( ~200 nm ) that confers intermediate mobility , while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion . Moreover , KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state , reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling . Importantly , both the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels . Our results reveal how membrane organization dictates membrane diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offer new insight into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling . \n The plasma membrane has a complex and dynamic landscape that helps shape how diverse membrane-localized signaling molecules behave ( Grecco et al . , 2011; Staubach and Hanisch , 2011; Simons and Toomre , 2000; Schmick and Bastiaens , 2014; Varma and Mayor , 1998; Garcia-Parajo et al . , 2014 ) . Among others , the Ras small GTPases are prototypical examples of signaling molecules whose biological activities are directly regulated by the membrane ( Zhou and Hancock , 2015; Abankwa et al . , 2010 ) . While biochemical aspects of how Ras interacts with downstream effectors such as Raf have been well studied ( Simanshu et al . , 2017; Cox and Der , 2010 ) , the mechanisms through which the biological membrane defines the signaling activity and specificity of Ras are still poorly understood . Recent studies by us and others suggest that Ras signaling may involve the formation of multimers ( dimers and\/or clusters ) in a membrane-dependent manner ( G\u00fcldenhaupt et al . , 2012; Nan et al . , 2015; Spencer-Smith et al . , 2017; Ambrogio et al . , 2018; Prior et al . , 2003; Inouye et al . , 2000; Plowman et al . , 2005 ) , and that partitioning of Ras into nanoscopic membrane domains and interactions with scaffold proteins or structures likely constitute critical steps to Ras multimer formation and signaling ( Zhou et al . , 2015; Chung et al . , 2018; Belanis et al . , 2008; Shalom-Feuerstein et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2016 ) . While previous high-resolution imaging experiments using immuno-EM ( Prior et al . , 2003; Plowman et al . , 2005 ) or quantitative superresolution microscopy ( Nan et al . , 2015; Huang et al . , 2015 ) were instrumental to revealing the existence of Ras multimers , the resulting images were mostly static and provided limited information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras \u2013 membrane domain interactions . Live-cell single-particle tracking ( SPT ) ( Schmidt et al . , 1996; Kusumi et al . , 2005; Saxton and Jacobson , 1997 ) complements static imaging by providing information about molecular motions , and it has been used to study Ras dynamics on the membrane ( Lommerse et al . , 2006; Murakoshi et al . , 2004; Lommerse et al . , 2004 ) . The underlying rationale is that interactions of Ras with different membrane domains and signaling partners would manifest as varied diffusion behavior . Indeed , using SPT , Murakoshi et al . observed transient events of Ras immobilization on the membrane , which became more frequent upon epidermal growth factor stimulation , potentially reflecting the formation of signaling complexes or interactions with raft domains ( Murakoshi et al . , 2004 ) . Lommerse and colleagues also used SPT to probe Ras diffusion and similarly observed transient and context-dependent confinement of Ras in membrane regions not more than 200 nm in diameter ( Lommerse et al . , 2006 ) . These prior studies offered important initial insight into the potential connections between Ras diffusion , function , and membrane organization , but the technical constraints of traditional SPT limited the imaging throughput and depth of analysis in these studies . Typically , only a few tens of trajectories could be obtained from each experiment , which precluded detailed and quantitative characterization of the heterogeneous and stochastic nature of molecular diffusion . In consequence , while the studies consistently reported two diffusion states \u2013 a \u2018free\u2019 diffusion state and another \u2018immobile\u2019 state , it remains to be seen whether a two-state model adequately recapitulates Ras membrane dynamics ( Lommerse et al . , 2006; Murakoshi et al . , 2004; Lommerse et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the nature of the membrane domains occupied by each of these states and how Ras molecules transition between the states in connection with multimer formation and signaling remain unclear . Recent years have seen significant advances in both experimental ( Manley et al . , 2008; Benke et al . , 2012; Huang et al . , 2018; Basu et al . , 2018; English , 2015; Cutler et al . , 2013 ) and data analysis strategies ( Persson et al . , 2013; Hansen et al . , 2018; Liu et al . , 2015; Jaqaman et al . , 2008; Chenouard et al . , 2014; Shen et al . , 2017; Monnier et al . , 2015; Ito et al . , 2017; Lind\u00e9n and Elf , 2018 ) of SPT , some of which have dramatically improved the information throughput . Among others , spt-PALM combines SPT with photoactivated localization microscopy ( PALM ) to enable single molecule tracking under dense labeling conditions through stochastic photoswitching ( Manley et al . , 2008 ) . With spt-PALM , it is routine to acquire thousands of diffusion trajectories from a single cell . A growing list of software tools has also been developed to facilitate spt-PALM data analysis ( Persson et al . , 2013; Hansen et al . , 2018; Jaqaman et al . , 2008; Ito et al . , 2017; Newby et al . , 2018 ) . For example , variational Bayes SPT ( vbSPT ) allows construction of a detailed diffusion model from spt-PALM data with parameters such as the number of states , the diffusion coefficient and the occupancy of each state , as well as the state transition rates even when the individual trajectories are short ( Persson et al . , 2013 ) . Additional methods have also been introduced to quantitate various aspects of diffusion dynamics from SPT trajectories ( Chenouard et al . , 2014; Ito et al . , 2017; Manzo and Garcia-Parajo , 2015 ) . These advances help overcome the limitations of conventional SPT and make it possible to analyze Ras membrane dynamics in much greater depth . Here , we report our efforts on combining spt-PALM with detailed trajectory analysis to reveal previously unknown aspects of Ras diffusion on the cell membrane . With carefully controlled expression levels and photoactivation rate , spt-PALM trajectories of PAmCherry1-tagged KRasG12D ( KRas with an activating mutation and thus primarily GTP-bound ) consistently reported three diffusion states , including a fast diffusion state , an immobile state , and a previously unidentified diffusion state with intermediate mobility . Leveraging the large number of trajectories , we were able to spatially map the diffusion states to distinctive membrane domains , estimate the size and lifetime of each domain , and define the spatial relationship between the domains . Moreover , in analyzing how KRasG12D transitions from one diffusion state to another , we discovered that KRasG12D diffusion follows a non-equilibrium steady state ( NESS ) model with net mass flow from the fast state to the immobile state , potentially coupled to the endocytic trafficking and membrane recycling of KRasG12D . Based on these results , we propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D , where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking , with implications in Ras multimer formation and signaling . \n To investigate the lateral diffusion properties of KRasG12D under controlled expression levels , we established isogenic U2OS cells stably expressing PAmCherry1-KRasG12D under doxycycline ( Dox ) regulation ( Nan et al . , 2015 ) . The expression level of PAmCherry1-KRasG12D could be tuned from a level below that of the endogenous KRas at\u00a0<1 ng\/mL Dox to highly over-expressed at 5\u201310 ng\/mL Dox ( Figure 1A ) . Initially data were collected from cells expressing KRasG12D at a moderate level by inducing at 2 ng\/mL Dox . The photoactivatable fluorescent protein PAmCherry1 has been widely used for quantitative PALM and spt-PALM ( Subach et al . , 2009 ) . Owing to the good single-molecule brightness of activated PAmCherry1 , we were able to track individual PAmCherry1-KRasG12D molecules at frame rates up to\u00a0~83 Hz ( i . e . , ~12 ms\/frame ) with a low excitation dose ( ~400 W\/cm2 at 561 nm ) . The low spontaneous photoactivation rate of PAmCherry1 also permits clean single-molecule imaging even at high expression levels , yielding as many as hundreds of thousands of trajectories per cell via spt-PALM ( Figure 1B and Video 1 ) . Under these conditions , the average trajectory lengths were\u00a0~4 and~5 frames for data acquired at 12 ms\/frame and 35 ms\/frame rates , respectively ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Despite the faster frame rate , data acquired at 12 ms\/frame had a lower signal-to-noise ratio , causing a more frequent loss of molecules during tracking to yield significantly shorter trajectories ( ~50 ms average duration ) than data\u00a0acquired at 35 ms\/frame ( ~175 ms average duration ) . We therefore used both frame rates in this work for the benefit of better temporal resolution or spatial precision . A close inspection of the individual trajectories clearly shows larger diffusive steps intermittent with moments of transient entrapment , indicating the presence of multiple diffusion states and frequent state transitions ( Figure 1C and inset ) . Similar observations were reported for both HRas and KRas in previous low throughput SPT experiments , where two diffusion states \u2013 a \u2018fast\u2019 state and an \u2018immobile\u2019 diffusion state \u2013 were detected ( Lommerse et al . , 2006; Murakoshi et al . , 2004 ) . Since spt-PALM offers a much larger number of trajectories , we first asked whether KRasG12D diffusion on the cell membrane could indeed be described by a simple two-state model . To this end , we used two methods to analyze the Ras diffusion trajectories . The first approach fits cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) for Brownian motion to the squared displacements of Ras trajectories to extract diffusion coefficients and the respective occupancies of the diffusion states ( Sch\u00fctz et al . , 1997 ) . The second method , vbSPT , treats particle diffusion and the associated state transitions with a Hidden Markov Model and performs model selection through variational inference ( Persson et al . , 2013 ) . Of note , vbSPT is well suited for analyzing large numbers of short trajectories such as those obtained via spt-PALM . We found that particle densities higher than 0 . 03 \u00b5m\u22122 per frame under our experimental conditions ( 12 ms\/frame with the fastest diffusion rate at\u00a0~1 \u00b5m2\/s ) led to occasional misconnected trajectories , and that even a small fraction of such misconnected trajectories could lead to skewed model outputs with vbSPT ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . In addition , the threshold for maximum particle displacement between adjacent frames also had an impact on trajectory misconnection , although to a lesser extent as tested with simulated trajectories ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) . Thus , for diffusion model construction , we chose to use a high frame rate ( 12 ms\/frame ) and a low particle density ( <0 . 03 \u00b5m\u22122 ) to eliminate misconnected trajectories while maintaining a sufficient number of trajectories . Using trajectories acquired and analyzed with the above precautions , both CDF fitting and vbSPT yielded similar three-state models for KRasG12D diffusion on the membrane of live U2OS cells . Specifically , CDF fitting to a three-state model had significantly lower residual error compared to a single- or a two-state model and further increasing the model size did not decrease the error ( Figure 1D ) , indicating that a three-state model is sufficient to describe the data . For vbSPT , a score equal to zero indicates the best model , a condition that was met with a three-state model but not with larger or smaller size models ( Figure 1E ) . To rule out the possibility of imprecise single-molecule localizations causing vbSPT to misinterpret two-state spt-PALM data as three states , we performed vbSPT analysis on simulated trajectories based on a two-state model with varying localizations errors ( 0 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 100 nm ) added . Even at the highest localization errors ( 100 nm ) , vbSPT correctly retrieved a two-state model ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) from the simulated data , suggesting that the three-state model derived from experimental spt-PALM data is unlikely a result of localization errors in SPT . The diffusion coefficient and the occupancy for each of the diffusion states were in good agreement between the two analysis methods and within each method when applied to different cells under the same conditions , as evidenced by the small errors ( Figure 1F ) . Datasets with high particle densities can return models with different sizes , sometimes also with aberrant model parameters ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013B ) ; even so , the histogram of all vbSPT-derived diffusion coefficients still showed three distinct clusters ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C ) corresponding to the three states listed in Figure 1F . Thus , we concluded that the membrane diffusion of KRasG12D under our experimental conditions is best described by a three-state model , demonstrating the existence of an intermediate state not detected in previous studies . Between the two methods , vbSPT was used for most subsequent analyses in the remainder of this work because it infers the transition probabilities and state identities for every time step whereas CDF does not . The diffusion coefficient of the slowest state in Figure 1F is comparable to that expected from single-molecule localization error ( ~40 nm , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6 ) , which implied that the actual diffusion of KRasG12D in this state may be even slower than it appeared . To test this hypothesis , we acquired spt-PALM data at a slower frame rate ( 35 ms\/frame ) to improve the localization accuracy of slowly moving molecules since more photons could now be collected for each PAmCherry1 molecule in a single frame ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . Indeed , these datasets reported a significantly smaller diffusion coefficient ( 0 . 02 \u00b5m2\/s ) for the slowest state than that obtained earlier ( 0 . 08 \u00b5m2\/s ) using data taken at 12 ms\/frame . This result suggests that the slowest diffusion state of KRasG12D is essentially an immobile state , consistent with previous reports ( Lommerse et al . , 2006; Murakoshi et al . , 2004 ) . The diffusion model presented in Figure 2A summarizes the results from the spt-PALM trajectory analyses using vbSPT . Each circle represents one of the diffusion states with arrows indicating the transition probabilities between pairs of states . A notable feature of this model is that there appears to be a defined state transition path: KRasG12D molecules always transition between the fast ( F ) and the immobile ( I ) states by going through the intermediate ( N ) state , and direct transitions between the fast and the immobile states almost never occur . In order to confirm this transition path , we compared the distribution of step sizes relative to the immobile state steps , since different step sizes reflect different diffusion coefficients . Consistent with the state transition path observed in Figure 2A , the histogram of step sizes immediately adjacent to the immobile steps corresponded to the intermediate diffusion state ( Figure 2B , blue ) while the distribution of the remaining steps had a broader peak implying a mixture of both fast and intermediate diffusion steps ( Figure 2B , where the black color indicates a mixture of states ) . As expected , the step sizes assigned to the immobile states ( Figure 2B , red ) are even smaller compared to that of the other two states . The clear separation of these three step size distributions confirms the above-mentioned transition path through the intermediate state . The distinctions in step sizes among the three states were even more obvious on data taken at 35 ms\/frame , which had better single-molecule localization precision ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , the intermediate state is not merely a state with intermediate mobility but effectively an obligatory link between the immobile and the fast states of KRasG12D . The observed state transition path may arise from at least two potential scenarios . In the first scenario , fast diffusing KRasG12D may transition into the intermediate then the immobile state through spontaneous conformational changes unrelated to slow or static membrane structures . Alternatively , the immobile states could be caused by KRasG12D transiently binding to stationary molecules or structures ( termed \u2018immobilization sites\u2019 or \u2018immobilization domains\u2019 ) residing in membrane regions ( referred to as \u2018intermediate domains\u2019 ) that confer intermediate mobility to KRasG12D . Consequently , these intermediate domains would act as transition zones between membrane regions where KRasG12D exhibits fast diffusion and the sites of KRasG12D immobilization , yielding the observed state transition path . In either case , the intermediate and the immobile states of KRasG12D would be temporally and spatially correlated . It is only in the latter case , however , that we would observe multiple visits to the same intermediate or immobilization domains by different KRasG12D molecules , provided that both domains have lifetimes longer than our temporal resolution . Of note , even\u00a0in\u00a0the second scenario , KRasG12D targeting to the intermediate or the immobilization domains may be accompanied by changes in conformation . To distinguish between the two scenarios , we performed auto- and cross-correlation analysis on the locations of KRasG12D exhibiting a certain diffusion state ( referred to hereafter as state coordinates ) . We first visually examined the spatial distributions of the states by slicing each raw image stack into one-minute time substacks and plotting the state coordinates on the same map , with each color representing one of the states ( Figure 2C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , and Video 2 ) . Each diffusion trajectory typically contributes only a few points to the plots as limited by its short duration , and the points from multiple trajectories accumulate over time ( up to 1 min in this case ) to \u2018paint\u2019 a map of the membrane regions associated with each diffusion state . Despite yielding relatively short trajectories , the rapid turn-over of PAmCherry1 allowed more efficient sampling ( \u2018painting\u2019 ) of the membrane domains by KRasG12D in the field of view . As shown in Figure 2C , the intermediate state locations and the immobile state locations not only co-clustered , but also each appeared to self-cluster . Specifically , regions corresponding to the intermediate states ( blue ) often connect to give rise to nanoscopic domains a few hundred nm in size , and the vast majority of the immobilization sites ( red ) are surrounded by the intermediate domains . By contrast , regions corresponding to the fast state occupy the majority of the membrane area . While both the intermediate and the immobilization domains appeared to be dynamic , a time-lapse domain map ( Video 2 ) showed that at least some of these domains could last a few minutes ( to be further addressed below in Figure 3 ) . Thus , spatial mapping of the KRasG12D state coordinates provided visual evidence for the physical presence of nested , nanoscopic domains conferring the distinct KRasG12D diffusion states . We next used pair correlation function ( g ( r ) ) to quantitate the spatial relationship between the KRasG12D diffusion states ( Figure 2D\u2013E ) . The function g ( r ) measures the ratio of the number of particles located a distance ( r ) from a given particle to that expected from a complete spatial randomness ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Here , the g ( r ) could be calculated for particles in the same diffusion state ( auto-correlation ) or between two different diffusion states ( cross-correlation ) ; in either case , amplitudes of g ( r ) significantly greater than that expected for a random distribution indicate spatial clustering . When multiple KRasG12D molecules visit the same domain , each at a different time point but exhibiting the same diffusion state , g ( r ) would detect spatial auto-correlation for the given state . To avoid false clustering due to the same molecule staying in the same state across multiple frames , we used the averaged state coordinate for each continuous trajectory segment that stayed in the same state for more than two consecutive time points ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Results from both datasets taken at 35 ms\/frame ( main panels ) and those at 12 ms\/frame ( inset ) are shown for comparison ( Figure 2D\u2013E ) . Consistent with the visual observation earlier ( Figure 2C ) , coordinates of the immobile and the intermediate states each showed significant clustering in the g ( r ) plots averaged across each 1 min raw image stacks , whereas g ( r ) of the fast state was barely above random across the full range of r analyzed ( Figure 2D ) . All g ( r ) negative controls were generated with a 2D Markovian simulation of diffusing particles with no associated domains ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) , and the simulated trajectories were processed through the same analysis pipeline as the experimental data . As expected , the averaged state coordinates of the simulated negative control had values close to one and showed no peak in the g ( r ) plots . Furthermore , g ( r ) based on spatial cross-correlation analysis clearly indicated co-clustering between the immobile and the intermediate state positions but not with the fast diffusion state ( Figure 2E ) . We also estimated the lower-bound size of the domains associated with the immobile and the intermediate states of KRasG12D by calculating the maximum distance a molecule traveled while in a domain ( i . e . , longest distance between two points within consecutive steps taken while in the same state ) . Shown in the main panel of Figure 2F are the histograms of the estimated domain sizes determined from data taken at 35 ms\/frame , based on which we determined that the mean diameters of the intermediate and the immobile membrane domains were approximately\u00a0~200 nm and\u00a0~70 nm , respectively . This is consistent with the notion that most immobilization domains are likely surrounded by intermediate domains . The distinction between the two domains became much less significant with data taken at 12 ms\/frame ( Figure 2F , inset ) , which we attributed to the shorter trajectory durations ( ~50 ms at 12 ms\/frame compared to\u00a0~175 ms at 35 ms\/frame; see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which in turn was due to the lower photon yield per frame from single PAmCherry1 molecules at this fast frame rate . In essence , the molecules failed to sample a large enough area within the short duration of the trajectories to report the domain size accurately . In addition , the distribution of the minimum intermediate domain size appeared to have at least two peaks at\u00a0~120 nm and\u00a0~230 nm , implying that there may potentially be multiple types of intermediate domains ( Figure 2F ) . To understand the temporal behavior of the immobilization and the intermediate domains associated with KRasG12D , we extended g ( r ) calculations as in Figure 2 from one minute to longer time intervals . The rationale was that , as the time interval for calculating g ( r ) increases beyond the lifetime of a domain , the chance of observing KRasG12D molecules visiting the same domain ( i . e . , exhibiting the same diffusion state in close proximity ) should decrease , resulting in lower g ( r ) amplitudes . Indeed , as shown in Figure 3A\u2013C , for dataset acquired at 12 ms frame interval , the peak amplitudes of g ( r ) for both the immobile ( Figure 3A ) and the intermediate ( Figure 3B ) states decreased significantly after\u00a0~5 min with further decay at increasing time intervals , indicative of finite lifetimes for both nanodomains , likely on the order of minutes on average ( see also Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 for results with data taken at 35 ms\/frame ) . For the limited temporal resolution of this analysis , we likely only detected relatively stable domains with lifetimes longer than 1 min , and the presence of more transient intermediate or immobilization domains should not be ruled out . To gain insight into how KRasG12D interacts with the different membrane domains , we also analyzed the frame-to-frame deflection angle for the molecules within each domain . The deflection angle measures the relationship between the current and the preceding step: a complete random walk would yield a flat distribution of deflection angles , whereas a preference for acute angles indicates more \u2018returning\u2019 steps . The measurement will likely be affected by localization error: for individual angles , larger localization error ( relative to the step sizes ) would add significant noise to the measured angles; for ensemble measurement of a large number of angles , however , the localization error would affect all angles in an unbiased manner . Thus , despite the finite localization precision at our frame rates , we expect that the measured step angles to reflect the interactions between KRasG12D and the membrane domains . Indeed , as shown in Figure 3D , KRasG12D molecules trapped in either the immobilization or the intermediate domains ( the red and the blue lines ) were more likely to exhibit acute deflection angles , potentially due to backward movements at the domain boundaries . Between the two domains , the enrichment of acute angles was more significant for the immobile state because the associated domains were smaller , such that KRasG12D molecules had a higher chance of hitting the domain boundaries . In comparison , KRasG12D molecules in the fast state exhibit ( Figure 3D , the green line ) equal probabilities of moving in all directions , consistent with Brownian motion . The small variance in the estimated model parameters from data taken on different cells , be it from the same or different samples ( Figure 2A ) , led us to hypothesize that KRasG12D membrane diffusion is in a steady state . To verify this , we divided each spt-PALM dataset with a minimum of 40 , 000 trajectories into four quarters ( each with\u00a0~10 , 000 trajectories and typically\u00a0~5 min long ) and computed the diffusion model for each quarter using vbSPT . As Figure 4A shows , the model parameters for all four quarters were essentially identical , which is the case for all qualifying datasets , confirming that KRasG12D diffusion is indeed in a steady state , at least in U2OS cells and at the investigated time scales ( up to\u00a0~20 min ) . In contradiction to KRasG12D diffusion being in a steady state , however , we found that the diffusion model as presented in Figure 2A cannot self-sustain . When using experimentally derived model parameters to simulate how the three-state system evolves over time ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) , we observed that the system quickly deviated from its initial configuration and instead stabilized at an entirely different set of state occupancies ( Figure 4B ) . In the new , \u2018equilibrated\u2019 system configuration , KRasG12D spends as much as\u00a0~50% of its time in the immobile state , significantly more than the observed steady state occupancy of\u00a0~11% . The fast state is the opposite: the population residing in this state is significantly reduced from\u00a0~58% to\u00a0~25% . By contrast , the intermediate state changes only slightly ( ~31% vs\u00a0~24% for the experimental observations\u00a0and the simulations , respectively ) . We confirmed that the simulated equilibrium probabilities were consistent with the principle of detailed balance ( Zuckerman , 2010 ) ( Figure 4C ) . Next , we also verified that the experimentally determined state occupancies in Figure 2A were not an artifact of vbSPT , since vbSPT correctly retrieved the steady state model parameters when applied to simulated trajectories from steady state models with varying input parameters ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Therefore , we concluded that the model in Figure 2A represents a non-equilibrium steady state ( NESS ) . To further characterize the NESS , we calculated the mass flow for each of the three KRasG12D diffusion states as the change in state occupancy per time interval . A positive net flow rate or a ratio of in- vs out-flux greater than one indicates an accumulation of mass for the state , while a negative flow rate or a ratio of flux less than one indicates the opposite . As shown in Figure 5A and B , within the NESS there is a net influx of KRasG12D molecules to the immobile state and a net outflux of molecules from the fast state , whereas the in- and out-fluxes for the intermediate state are comparable . We also calculated the mass flow for each of the three arms in the diffusion model in Figure 2A \u2013 in the clockwise direction , it would be the flow from the fast state to the intermediate state ( F to N ) , intermediate to immobile ( N to I ) , and immobile to fast ( I to F ) . The results of this calculation are shown in Figure 5C , where a positive value in the y axis ( net mass flow between a pair of states ) indicates mass flow in the designated direction , and a negative value indicates flow in the opposite direction . Consistent with results in Figure 5A and B , the dominant net mass flow through the NESS is unidirectional \u2013 from the fast state to the intermediate to the immobile state ( Figure 5C ) \u2013 with minimal \u2018leakage\u2019 from the fast to the immobile state . These results are consistent with the simulated system relaxation to equilibrium shown in Figure 4B , where the immobile and the fast diffusion states changed occupancies the most . For the KRasG12D NESS system to be sustained over time as we observed experimentally , KRasG12D would need to be replenished into the fast diffusion state and removed from the immobile state . Indeed , KRasG12D has previously been shown to undergo a constant exchange between the plasma membrane and the cytosol , and internalized KRasG12D is collected at recycling endosomes and transported back to the plasma membrane ( Schmick et al . , 2014; Schmick et al . , 2015 ) . Our analyses suggest that the loss of KRasG12D from the membrane could be through the immobile state , and the replenishment through the fast state . At present , it is unclear whether the intermediate state has no exchange with the cytosol or has active exchange with equal gain and loss . Accordingly , the membrane trafficking of KRasG12D should follow the model presented in Figure 5D , where the arrows indicate the net mass flow between the connected states as well as between the states ( F or I ) and the environment ( such as the cytosol ) . Next , we sought to investigate whether experimental conditions such as expression level would alter the diffusion properties of KRasG12D . An important observation on Ras nanocluster ( multimer ) formation is that the fraction of clustered molecules remains constant over a broad range of expression levels ( Plowman et al . , 2005 ) . This unusual property has led to two hypothetical mechanisms of membrane nanocluster formation: one based on protein self-nucleation ( Plowman et al . , 2005 ) and another involving actomyosin activity ( Gowrishankar et al . , 2012 ) . These active mechanisms are in contrast to passive localization of Ras to existing membrane nanodomains ( e . g . via diffusion ) , which was thought to result in concentration-dependent multimer formation and therefore be inconsistent with the constant fraction of clustered Ras . To date , it remains controversial as to which mechanism mediates Ras multimer formation , including the basic question of whether membrane nanodomains are involved . We reasoned that , if KRasG12D multimers form in membrane nanodomains \u2013 for example the intermediate and\/or the immobilization domains in this case \u2013 then the observed fraction ( s ) of KRasG12D in either or both the intermediate and the immobile states should also be independent of expression level , as for the fraction of Ras molecules in multimers ( clusters ) . To address this question , we induced PAmCherry1-KRasG12D at a range of expression levels using different Dox concentrations ( Figure 1A ) . Similar to our previous report ( Nan et al . , 2015 ) , the expression level of PAmCherry1-KRasG12D responded well to varying Dox concentrations in the isogenic cells used in this study , with the protein expression at 0 ng\/mL being extremely low ( only due to occasional leakage in tetR suppression ) and that at 10 ng\/mL about 5\u201310 fold higher than endogenous KRasG12D . When measured in terms of protein density at the membrane , the tuning range corresponds to\u00a0<10 molecules per \u00b5m2 at 0 ng\/mL Dox to\u00a0>300 molecules per \u00b5m2 at 10 ng\/mL Dox . By comparing estimated model parameters using spt-PALM data of PAmCherry1-KRasG12D at different Dox concentrations , we found that KRasG12D diffusion properties remained essentially the same across the range of expression levels investigated ( Figure 6A\u2013B and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This model invariance is reflected across all conditions: not only was a three-state model optimal for describing the diffusion of KRasG12D as judged with vbSPT ( not shown ) and with CDF ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , but the diffusion coefficients of each state , the state occupancies , as well as the transition probabilities between each pair of states , were indistinguishable within the error bars . As expected , the net mass flow rates ( expressed as the change in state occupancy per time interval ) of KRasG12D within the system also remained the same across all the Dox concentrations ( Figure 6C\u2013D ) . A similar observation was made when we acquired the trajectories at 35 ms\/frame ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Thus , we concluded that KRasG12D diffusion and trafficking on the membrane remains constant over the range of tested KRasG12D expression levels . Equivalently , the partitioning of KRasG12D in each of the three diffusive states \u2013 and the corresponding membrane domains \u2013 is stable and independent of KRasG12D protein density on the membrane . This result coincides with the prior observation that the fraction of Ras in multimers remains constant at widely varying membrane densities ( Plowman et al . , 2005 ) , implying that Ras multimer formation and nanodomain localization may be correlated processes . \n Membrane nanodomains have been implicated in the regulation of many membrane-resident cellular processes such as Ras signaling ( Grecco et al . , 2011; Staubach and Hanisch , 2011; Simons and Toomre , 2000; Schmick and Bastiaens , 2014; Varma and Mayor , 1998; Garcia-Parajo et al . , 2014 ) , but studying the complex and heterogeneous membrane compartments in a living cell has remained a challenge . Using spt-PALM and detailed trajectory analysis , we were able to uncover rich details of how KRasG12D localizes and interacts with the membrane . Our results suggest that KRasG12D diffusion on the membrane is best recapitulated with a model that comprises three states \u2013 a fast state , an immobile state , and a previously unknown intermediate state . Leveraging the large number of diffusion trajectories , we were able to map the locations where KRasG12D exhibits specific diffusion states . These maps revealed membrane nanodomains corresponding to the intermediate and the immobile states of KRasG12D . The intermediate nanodomains encompass the immobilization sites in a nested configuration , such that KRasG12D almost always transitions between the fast and the immobile states through the intermediate state . We also found that KRasG12D membrane diffusion is in a non-equilibrium steady state , with KRasG12D constitutively removed from the membrane through the immobile sites and replenished as fast diffusing molecules , potentially coupled to KRasG12D trafficking via endocytosis and recycling . Importantly , partitioning of KRasG12D into the three states remains invariant over a wide range of KRasG12D expression levels , demonstrating that KRasG12D diffusion and trafficking through the three mobility states and associated nanodomains is in a maintained , homeostatic condition . Together , these data start to paint a clear picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of KRasG12D on the membrane , providing the basis for understanding the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling . Based on these findings , we propose a new model for Ras membrane diffusion and trafficking as shown in Figure 7 . In this model , Ras experiences at least three types of membrane environments: a \u2018regular\u2019 membrane region in which Ras freely diffuses with large step sizes , a \u2018transition zone\u2019 or intermediate domain with increased viscous drag and reduced step size , and within the latter an \u2018immobilization\u2019 site where Ras interacts with relatively static structures or molecules . Both the transition zones and the immobilization sites have finite lifetimes , some up to minutes , during which freely diffusing KRasG12D molecules could enter the transition zone , slow down , then either return to the fast state or become trapped at the immobilization sites . During entrapment , a fraction of the trapped KRasG12D molecules leaves the plasma membrane to enter the cycle of KRasG12D trafficking . This is in agreement with the current understanding that the removal of KRas\u00a0from the membrane through endocytosis is concentration dependent and that\u00a0the localization of KRas\u00a0to the plasma membrane is an energy driven , PDE\u03b4 and Arl2-mediated enrichment process ( Schmick et al . , 2014; Schmick et al . , 2015 ) . Our work adds important details to this trafficking model in that the removal of KRasG12D from the plasma membrane likely occurs during the entrapment phase and its recycling primarily takes place in membrane regions conferring fast mobility . Additionally , the transient entrapment of KRasG12D could also provide an effective mechanism to locally concentrate Ras molecules to facilitate multimer formation , which arguably is a critical step for signaling ( Chen et al . , 2016; Tian et al . , 2007; Nussinov et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , the various membrane nanodomains directly influence the mobility , trafficking , and potentially multimer formation and signaling of KRasG12D , although details of the trafficking and multimer formation processes are yet to be defined . The three-state diffusion model proposed in this study refines existing models of KRasG12D membrane diffusion by introducing a previously unresolved intermediate state and capturing the role of membrane nanodomains in KRasG12D diffusion . While heterogeneous diffusion properties of KRasG12D and other Ras isoforms have been reported , the prior studies lacked the throughput or spatiotemporal resolutions to determine whether two states , namely a fast diffusion state and an immobile state , are adequate to recapitulate KRasG12D diffusion on the membrane . With the diffusion model defined , we were able to subsequently demonstrate that the intermediate and immobile states of KRasG12D are each associated with a distinct membrane domain . The measured sizes of the immobilization and the intermediate domains of KRasG12D were\u00a0~70 nm and\u00a0~200 nm , respectively , consistent with previous beliefs that nanoscopic membrane domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane . We note that , although a three-state model best fits our data , the model could still be an over-simplification . Among other possibilities , both endocytic and non-endocytic mechanisms may contribute to the immobilization of Ras but cannot be distinguished based on diffusion properties since Ras is immobile in both cases . In fact , there are also indications of more than one type of intermediate domains judging from the estimated domain size ( Figure 2F and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . An important feature of the model in Figure 7 is that the membrane nanodomains associated with the immobile state of KRasG12D are surrounded by those associated with the intermediate state , creating a nested configuration between the two nanodomains . A plausible scenario is that the structures that trap KRasG12D preferentially form in the membrane regions enriched in certain proteins or lipids and\/or more densely packed . In this scenario , KRasG12D would have to travel through the intermediate zone to access the immobilization structures , explaining the state transition pathway in Figure 2A . This scenario is also consistent with the observation that the intermediate domains are on average larger in size than the immobilization domains , and that the two nanodomains have similar lifetimes ( to the extent of our temporal resolution ) . In support of this hypothetic scenario , a growing body of literature demonstrates the importance of phosphatidylserine in KRas clustering and activation ( Zhou et al . , 2015; Cho et al . , 2016; Zhou et al . , 2017; Ariotti et al . , 2014 ) . In addition to the KRas tail encoding for phosphatidylserine specificity , a significant fraction of phosphatidylserine display slow motion on the membrane as well ( Zhou et al . , 2017; Kay et al . , 2012 ) . Aside from the steady state partitioning of KRasG12D in the different membrane domains , our data also offered important insight into the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D . We measured a constant flow of KRasG12D from the fast state to the immobile state . Without exchanging KRasG12D with the cytosol , this directional flow would have caused net loss of KRasG12D from the fast state and accumulation in the immobile state as described in Figure 4B\u2013C , yet the experimentally observed state configuration ( Figure 2A ) remained stable over time ( Figure 4A ) . We therefore reasoned that KRasG12D needs to be constantly removed from the immobile state ( \u2018sink\u2019 ) and replenished via the fast state ( \u2018source\u2019 ) , potentially coupled to membrane trafficking such as endocytosis and recycling ( Schmick et al . , 2014; Schmick et al . , 2015; Roy et al . , 2002; Rocks et al . , 2005; Lu et al . , 2009 ) , since previous studies have shown that endocytosis is a primary mechanism for KRasG12D removal from the plasma membrane ( Schmick et al . , 2014 ) . In support of this , the lifetime of the immobilization domains was estimated to be on the order of 2\u20135 min on average ( Figure 3A\u2013B ) , which is typical of many endocytic systems ( Mayor et al . , 2014; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . The exact mechanism of KRasG12D internalization , however , remains incompletely understood at present . It is noteworthy that the spatial partitioning of KRasG12D and more generally the diffusion model were invariant over a broad range of KRasG12D expression levels , which coincides with previous observations where the clustered fraction of KRas or HRas was independent of the protein expression level ( Plowman et al . , 2005; Tian et al . , 2007 ) . This corroborates the idea that membrane partitioning of Ras and perhaps many other membrane resident molecules are in an actively maintained , homeostatic condition . This intriguing property of certain membrane proteins ( Plowman et al . , 2005; Sharma et al . , 2004 ) has drawn much attention and led to at least two mechanistic models of multimer formation , one based on self-nucleation ( Plowman et al . , 2005 ) and the other driven by actomyosin ( Gowrishankar et al . , 2012 ) . Both mechanisms assumed the different states of the protein on the plasma membrane to be in equilibrium . Our results argue that the mass exchange between the plasma membrane and the cytosol breaks the equilibrium and has to be taken into account in order to accurately model the partitioning behavior of membrane proteins . A clear , mechanistic understanding of this property is important to understand how Ras functions on the membrane , since the Ras multimers have been strongly implicated in signaling . Further experimental and computational work along this line is currently underway . A fundamental albeit implicit result from the present study is the importance of experimental parameters in accurately determining the diffusion model , a critical step for in-depth analysis of protein dynamics on the membrane . While there are many different software packages for analyzing spt-PALM trajectories , the importance of controlling the particle density during image acquisition has not previously been recognized to our knowledge . Imaging at a per frame particle density of 0 . 05\u20130 . 1 per \u00b5m2 , which is typical for single-molecule localization microscopy , yielded varying estimated model parameters in our early attempts to track KRasG12D with spt-PALM ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135 ) . Using simulations , we found the source of variability to be a small fraction of misconnected trajectories mostly caused by fast moving molecules . In order to minimize the trajectory misconnection , we kept the density of activated PAmCherry1 in each frame to below 0 . 03 per \u00b5m2 at an acquisition rate of 12 ms\/frame ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) . With this precaution , we were able to yield a highly consistent diffusion model from trajectories acquired in different cells and under different conditions . This was critical to defining a previously unresolved state with intermediate mobility ( D\u00a0~\u00a00 . 3 \u00b5m2\/s ) and to all subsequent analyses . We recommend the same precautions to be taken for studies of other membrane molecules . In summary , our work sheds new light on how complex nanodomains organize on the membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking . The insights gained here offer useful guidance to future experiments that aim at determining the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and defining the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling . The results demonstrate the utility of high-throughput SPT and trajectory analysis in uncovering rich details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras on the membrane , which should be readily applicable to studies of other membrane molecules or processes in cellular compartments . \n KRasG12D was genetically fused to PAmCherry1 , a red fluorescent protein , to ensure high labeling specificity and efficiency . The PAmCherry1-KRasG12D coding sequence is placed under a CMV promoter regulated by the TetOn operon . The construct was transduced via lentivirus into an isogenic U2OS-tetR cell line ( RRID:CVCL_XZ88 ) that constitutively expresses the tet repressor ( tetR ) ; the cell line was derived from the parent U2OS ( human osteosarcoma , ATCC; RRID:CVCL_0042; verified via third party STR analysis ) . Single cell clones were subsequently isolated and screened to yield isogenic cell lines ( RRID:CVCL_XZ89 ) that express the PAmCherry1-KRasG12D fusion protein under doxycycline ( Dox ) regulation . Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma regularly using standard in-house PCR test . Cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 24\u201348 hr before lysing with a RIPA buffer ( Thermo Scientific , 89901 ) supplemented with an inhibitor cocktail ( ThermoFisher , 88668 ) . Cell lysates were then harvested , sonicated , and centrifuged . The supernatant is assayed using BCA and analyzed using a Bris-Tris gel ( 4\u201312% , ThermoFisher NP0323 ) . Protein transfer was performed on a low fluorescence PVDF membrane ( EMD Millipore , IPFL10100 ) . The membrane was then immunostained for fluorescence detection using a Li-COR Odyssey . The antibodies used for this study were: KRas ( mouse monoclonal , Abcam ab55391 , RRID:AB_941040 , used at 1:200 dilution ) , Tubulin ( mouse monoclonal , ThermoFisher 32\u20132600 , RRID:AB_86547 , used at 1:500 dilution ) . Cells were grown in fluorobrite DMEM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific A1896701 ) with 10% FBS in 8-well Lab-Tek chambers and Dox-induced for 1 . 5 days before imaging . Cells were serum starved for at least 12 hr prior to data acquisition . Single-particle tracking was performed on a custom single-molecule localization microscopy setup , as previously described ( Creech et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , the setup was constructed around a Nikon Ti-U microscope , equipped with a high numerical aperture ( NA ) objective lens ( Nikon 60x , NA\u00a0=\u00a01 . 49 oil immersion ) for total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) imaging , lasers emitting at 405 nm ( Coherent , OBIS ) and 561 nm ( Opto-Engine ) for photoactivation and excitation , respectively , and an electron-multiplied charge-coupled display ( EM-CCD , Andor iXon+ ) for single molecule detection . All image acquisition was done using micro-manager ( Edelstein et al . , 2014 ) ( RRID:SCR_000415 ) and processed using in-house Matlab scripts ( Creech et al . , 2017 ) . We found that particle densities higher than 0 . 03 \u00b5m\u22122 per frame under our experimental conditions ( 12 ms\/frame with the fastest diffusion rate at\u00a0~1 \u00b5m2\/s ) led to occasionally misconnected trajectories , and that even a small fraction of such misconnected trajectories could lead to incorrect model outputs with vbSPT ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 , and 5 ) . In addition , the threshold for maximum displacement between adjacent frames also had an impact on trajectory misconnection , although to a lesser extent for the values tested using simulated trajectories ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) . Thus , for diffusion model construction , we chose to use a high frame rate ( 12 ms\/frame ) and a low particle density ( <0 . 03 \u00b5m\u22122 ) to eliminate misconnected trajectory segments while maintaining a sufficient number of trajectories . However , it is beneficial to obtain more trajectories to accurately infer the model parameters with vbSPT ( RRID:\u00a0SCR_017554 ) , especially for the transition probabilities ( Persson et al . , 2013 ) . As demonstrated in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 , the diffusion coefficients and the occupancies typically converged with only a few thousand trajectories , but the transition probabilities required significantly more trajectories to converge . Thus , we usually acquired spt-PALM data at higher particle densities once the model size has been defined; for these datasets , we could safely enforce a three-state model during vbSPT data analysis , since the diffusion model should not depend on the rates of frame acquisition rate and photoactivation . This strategy allowed more flexibility in spt-PALM data acquisition and robustness in the subsequent analyses . We constructed single-molecule diffusion trajectories of PAmCherry1-KRasG12D by connecting the centroid positions of the same particles in successive frames . Particles in adjacent frames were deemed to be the same particle if their centroids were within a certain threshold distance . To define the threshold distance , we first constructed the trajectories using a large ( ~2 , 000 nm ) distance , from which a step size histogram could be obtained ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The step size histogram from PAmCherry1-KRasG12D typically consists of two segments; signal and noise . The first segment comprises the signal with the first peak around\u00a0~70 nm and extending to\u00a0~500 nm , and all step sizes beyond\u00a0~500 nm was attributed to noise originating from misconnected trajectories generated by the unrealistically large threshold distance . Based on this histogram , we reconstructed the diffusion trajectories using 500 nm as the threshold distance for 12 ms frame acquisition , and 800 nm for 35 ms frame rate movies ( using the same method ) . A new step size histogram was then obtained , which was essentially identical to the first segment of the original step size histogram , confirming that the new threshold distance eliminated most of the misconnected trajectories . The step size histograms of trajectories obtained under the same conditions were also highly consistent , allowing us to set the same threshold value for each condition . Trajectories were terminated if multiple particles were found within the threshold distance in the next frame . Further , all movies acquired at 12 ms frame rate had the additional constraint of having fewer than 0 . 03 particles\/\u00b5m2 for every frame to lower the chance of misconnecting two different particles in adjacent frames . Thus , all resulting trajectories were constructed without ambiguity . We relied on 2D simulations that mimic experimental observations for both experiment optimization and as controls for some of the analysis . Simulations were used to determine the thresholds used for trajectory synthesis ( particle density threshold as shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 , and connection distance threshold as shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , as well as a negative control to test the null hypothesis for spatial clustering ( Figure 2 and 3 ) and equilibrium state analysis ( Figure 4 ) . The inputs to the simulations were experimentally derived diffusion parameters: number of trajectories , diffusion coefficients , occupancies , transition matrix , frame rate , and the trajectory density . The trajectory density and the number of trajectories are used to determine the width of the simulation space . At the start of the simulation , every particle is randomly assigned a coordinate and a state based on the occupancies . Once a state is assigned , particles are assigned new coordinates by drawing displacements for each dimension from the corresponding X ~ N ( 0 , 2Dt ) , where each state has a different diffusion coefficient . At the next time step , a new state is randomly assigned to every particle based on its current state and the transition probability matrix . This process is repeated for the total simulation time . When the simulation was used as the negative control ( Figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) , the simulation was run for every single movie acquired and the results were compared to the experiment . States for each trajectory segment were assigned using vbSPT ( contained in field est2 . sMaxP , refer to the vbSPT manual ) . The state assignment is based on trajectory displacements , not the coordinates ( e . g . if a trajectory has three coordinates , then two states are returned for the two steps ) . In order to prevent over counting for the pair correlation analysis ( Figure 2 and 3 ) , in the case of a single molecule staying in the same domain for multiple frames , we averaged all of the coordinates ( including both ends ) that were assigned the same state for consecutive time points in a single trajectory . Pair correlation function , or g ( r ) , in general , measures the deviation of the particle density from the expected value from a reference particle as a function of distance . More specifically , g ( r ) was calculated for each particle by counting the number of other particles within a circular shell at distance of r and r + 10 nm and dividing by the expected number of particles assuming uniform distribution . Therefore , when the observed number of particles for a given distance is equal to the expected number of particles given complete spatial randomness , g ( r ) =1 and signifies random distribution of particles . Accordingly , g ( r ) >1 indicates clustering behavior since there are more observed particles around each particle than expected , and g ( r ) <1 represents cases where there are fewer particles than expected . Every movie was sliced into non-overlapping time segments ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 min ) and the average position for each state segment was extracted ( as described in State Classification and Averaging ) such that every coordinate represented a continuous track for an individual particle in a domain . Therefore , the coordinates used to calculate the pair correlation function represented either different particles that visited the same domain or the same particle that left the domain and returned at a later time . The resulting coordinates were separated into each of the three states , and the g ( r ) was calculated for the coordinates of a given state within the given time slice . In cross pair correlation function analysis , g ( r ) was calculated for a given pair of different states . Sample size is shown for each figure in the figure captions as \u2018n\u2019 and was not predetermined . All results on model parameters and subsequent quantifications such as mass-flow rates are shown as arithmetic mean\u00a0\u00b195% confidence interval . Spt-PALM datasets with insufficient number of trajectories to fully fit up to a 10-state model ( e . g . Figure 1E ) using vbSPT were discarded . The full raw dataset , including an outlier with abnormally long average trajectory length and all the discarded datasets are presented in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["structural biology and molecular biophysics","physics of living systems"],"id":"elife-46393-v2"}
{"lay_summary":"How biological systems interact with magnetic fields is of great interest both from a basic science perspective and for technological applications . Certain animal species can sense the Earth\u2019s magnetic field for the purposes of navigation . How that compass sense works is perhaps the last true mystery of sensory biology . If we knew how the magnetic field affects the activity of nerve cells , we could harness that mechanism to create new biomedical tools . One technological goal is to genetically engineer specific cells in the brain or elsewhere so their activity can be controlled using an external magnet . This dream has been called \u201cmagnetogenetics\u201d . In recent months a string of reports claimed to have solved both the scientific and the technological challenges of magnetogenetics . They all involved the discovery or the engineering of protein molecules that are sensitive to magnetic fields . Markus Meister has now checked whether those claims were consistent with well-established physical laws . For each case , Meister calculated how strongly the protein in question would link magnetic fields to cellular activity . The results show that the predicted effects are too weak to account for the reported measurements by huge margins: between five and ten orders of magnitude . It therefore appears that none of these reports have hit on a solution to magnetogenetics . All of the proposed proteins use iron atoms to couple to the magnetic field , but Meister concludes that these proteins contain far too few iron atoms . How safe is that conclusion ? There has been enormous technological interest in making tiny magnets; for example , to design the ever-denser data storage drives inside computers . Hence the magnetism of small clusters of atoms is exceedingly well understood . If any of the biological reports of magnetogenetics turned out correct , they would force a revolutionary rethinking of basic physics . With the recognition that magnetogenetics remains unsolved , and that different approaches are needed , Meister hopes that other investigators will feel motivated to continue innovating in this area .","article":"This is an analysis of how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and cells . It was prompted by a series of prominent reports regarding magnetism in biological systems . The first claims to have identified a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals ( Qin et al . , 2016 ) . Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field ( Stanley et al . , 2015; Wheeler et al . , 2016 ) . Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics . The discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units . If the reported phenomena do in fact occur , they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors . The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells . \n There has been renewed interest recently in the effects of magnetic fields on biological cells . On the one hand we have the old puzzle of magnetosensation: How do organisms sense the Earth\u2019s magnetic field for the purpose of navigation ? The biophysical basis for this ability is for the most part unresolved . On the other hand lies the promise of 'magnetogenetics': the dream of making neurons and other cells responsive to magnetic fields for the purpose of controlling their activity with ease . The two are closely linked , because uncovering Nature\u2019s method for magnetosensation can point the way to effectively engineering magnetogenetics . The physical laws by which magnetic fields act on matter are taught to science students in college ( Feynman et al . , 1963 ) . Obviously those principles impose some constraints on what biological mechanisms are plausible candidates , for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics . A recent spate of high-profile articles has put forward audacious proposals in this domain without any attempt at such reality checks . My goal here is to offer some calculations as a supplement to those articles , which makes them appear in a rather different light . These arguments should also help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools . \n Generally speaking , magnetic fields interact only weakly with biological matter . The reason magnetic fields are used for whole-body medical imaging , and why they have such appeal for magnetogenetics , is that they penetrate through tissues essentially undisturbed . The other side of this coin is that evolution had to develop rather special mechanisms to sense a magnetic field at all , especially one as weak as the Earth\u2019s field . This mechanism is well understood in just one case: that of magnetotactic bacteria ( Bazylinski and Frankel , 2004 ) . These organisms are found commonly in ponds , and they prefer to live in the muck at the bottom rather than in open water . When the muck gets stirred up they need to return to the bottom , and they accomplish this by following the magnetic field lines down . For that purpose , the bacterium synthesizes ferrimagnetic crystals of magnetite and arranges them in a chain within the cell . This gives the bacterium a permanent magnetic moment , and allows it to act like a small compass needle . The cell\u2019s long axis aligns with the magnetic field and flagella in the back of the cell propel it along the field lines . It has been suggested that magnetosensation in animals similarly relies on a magnetite mechanism , for example by coupling the movement of a small magnetic crystal to a membrane channel ( Kirschvink et al . , 2001 ) . A competing proposal for magnetosensation suggests that the magnetic field acts on single molecules in certain biochemical reactions ( Ritz et al . , 2010 ) . In this so-called 'radical pair mechanism' the products of an electron transfer reaction depend on the equilibrium between singlet and triplet states of a reaction intermediate , and this equilibrium can be biased by an applied magnetic field . These two hypotheses and their respective predictions for magnetosensation have been reviewed extensively ( Johnsen and Lohmann , 2005; Kirschvink et al . , 2010 ) . On this background , a recent article by Qin et al . ( 2016 ) introduces a new proposal . As for magnetotactic bacteria , the principle is that of a compass needle that aligns with the magnetic field , but here the needle consists of a single macromolecule . This putative magnetic receptor protein was isolated from the fruit fly and forms a rod-shaped multimeric complex that includes 40 iron atoms . The authors imaged individual complexes by electron microscopy on a sample grid . They claim ( 1 ) that each such rod has an intrinsic magnetic moment , and ( 2 ) that this moment is large enough to align the rods with the earth\u2019s magnetic field: \u201cabout 45% of the isolated rod-like protein particles oriented with their long axis roughly parallel to the geomagnetic field\u201d . We will see that neither claim is plausible based on first principles: With the goal of controlling the activity of neurons , Wheeler et al . ( 2016 ) reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane . Their single-component protein consists of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel ( TRPV4 ) fused on the intracellular face to two subunits of ferritin . The hope was that \u201cthe paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel to depolarize cells\u201d . Indeed , the report includes experimental results from several preparations suggesting that neural activity can be modulated by static magnetic fields ( There is a similar claim in Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) ; but the evidence is scant and hard to interpret: only 18 of ~2000 cells 'responded' ( their Supplementary Figure 10 ) ) . What could be the underlying biophysical mechanism ? Ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter . Wheeler et al . ( 2016 ) suppose optimistically that the two subunits of ferritin attached to the channel protein are able to nucleate an entire 24-subunit ferritin complex . The hollow core of this particle can be filled with iron in the form of a ferric hydroxide ( Arosio et al . , 2009 ) . At room temperature ferritin has no permanent magnetization: it is strictly paramagnetic or superparamagnetic ( Papaefthymiou , 2010 ) . Unlike the magnetite particles in magnetotactic bacteria , the iron core of ferritin is too small ( ~5 nm ) to sustain a permanent dipole moment ( blocking temperature ~40 K ) . Instead the direction of the Fe spins in the core fluctuates thermally . An external magnetic field biases these fluctuations , producing a magnetic moment m proportional to the field B of ( 7 ) m=\u00a0\u03beB , where \u03be is the magnetizability of a ferritin particle . This quantity can be derived from bulk measurements of ferritin magnetic susceptibility ( see Methods ) at ( 8 ) \u03be=2 . 4\u00d710\u221222JT2 . I will consider four scenarios by which such a ferritin particle might be manipulated with an external magnetic field . In the first , the magnetic field has a gradient , and the particle is pulled in the direction of higher field strength . In the second , the force arises from interactions among neighboring ferritins through their induced magnetic moments . In the third , the magnetic field exerts a torque assuming that the ferritin core is anisotropic , with a preferred axis of magnetization . Finally , the collective pull of many ferritins on the cell membrane may induce a stress that opens stretch-activated channels . For a different mode of activating membrane channels , Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) combined the expression of ferritin protein with that of the temperature-sensitive membrane channel TRPV1 . The hope was that a high-frequency magnetic field could be used to heat the iron core of ferritin , leading to a local temperature increase sufficient to open the TRPV1 channels , allowing cations to flow into the cell . Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) compared three different options for interaction between the ion channels in the plasma membrane and the ferritin protein: In one case the ferritin was expressed in the cytoplasm , in another it was targeted to the membrane by a myristoyl tail , and in the third it was tethered directly to the channel protein by a camelid antibody linkage . The direct one-to-one linkage between ferritin and ion channel worked best for generating Ca influx via high-frequency magnetic fields , leading the authors to conclude that \u201cBecause temperature decays as the inverse distance from the particle surface , heat transfer is likely to be most efficient for this construct , suggesting that heat transfer from the particle could be limiting the efficiency of the other constructs . \u201d Here I consider whether heat transfer from the ferritin particle is a likely source of thermal activation for the TRPV1 channel at all . Magnetic heating of nanoparticles is indeed a very active area of research ( Pankhurst et al . , 2003 ) . A sample biomedical application is to inject nanoparticles into cancerous tissue , and then damage the tumor selectively by magnetic heating ( Hergt et al . , 2006; Maier-Hauff et al . , 2011 ) . Typical nanoparticles of interest are made of magnetite or maghemite , sometimes doped with other metals , and measure some tens of nanometers in size ( Hergt et al . , 2006 ) . A typical heating apparatus for small preparations \u2013 like in the experiments of Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) \u2013 consists of an electric coil with a few windings , several centimeters in diameter , that carries a large oscillating current . The magnetic fields generated inside the coil are on the order of tens of kA\/m at frequencies of several 100 kHz ( The literature sometimes refers misleadingly to heating by \u201cradio waves\u201d or \u201celectromagnetic radiation\u201d . At these frequencies the wavelength of a radio wave is about a kilometer , so of no practical relevance to the experiments . There is no radiation involved in the interaction between the solenoid coil and the nanoparticle ) . Owing to the small size of the nanoparticles , the physics of heating are quite different from the processes in our kitchen . A microwave oven heats water primarily by flipping molecular dipoles in an oscillating electric field . And an induction stove works by inducing electric eddy currents in the pot\u2019s bottom with an oscillating magnetic field . Neither of these electric effects plays any role for nanoparticles . Instead the heat is generated purely by magnetic forces ( Hergt et al . , 2006 ) . Part of this comes from reorienting the magnetization of the material at high frequency , which is opposed by the particle\u2019s magnetic anisotropy , causing dissipation and heat . For larger nanoparticles , the oscillating magnetic field may also make the particle move , with resulting dissipation from external friction in the surrounding medium . These physical processes have been modeled in great detail , and there is a large experimental literature to determine the heating rates that can be accomplished with different kinds of nanoparticles . A figure of merit is the \u201cspecific loss power ( SLP ) \u201d , namely the heating power that can be generated per unit mass of the magnetic material ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . What sort of heating rate would we expect for the ferritin particles used by Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) ? Given the long-standing interest in ferritin for medical engineering ( Babincova et al . , 2000 ) , the extensive research on its magnetic properties ( Papaefthymiou , 2010 ) , and the ease with which magnetic heating can be measured , it is surprisingly difficult to find any published evidence for magnetic heating in ferritin . One report on the subject concludes simply that there is none: ferritin shells reconstituted with a magnetite core produced no measurable magnetic heating ( SLP < 0 . 1 W\/g ) , whereas doping the iron with varying amounts of cobalt did produce some modest heating rates ( Fantechi et al . , 2014 ) . Why is native ferritin such a poor heater ? Both theory and experiment show that the efficiency of heating magnetic nanoparticles depends strongly on the particle size , and plummets steeply below 10 nm ( Fortin et al . , 2007; Purushotham and Ramanujan , 2010 ) . Magnetite particles smaller than 8 nm are not considered useful for magnetic hyperthermia ( Fantechi et al . , 2015 ) . The iron core of ferritin measures only 5\u20136 nm in diameter . Furthermore , the ferric hydroxide material in native ferritin has much lower magnetic susceptibility than magnetite ( ~8-fold , Zborowski et al . , 1996 ) . So , based on the literature , the heating rate for ferritin is too low to be measurable . Obviously this casts doubt on the claims of Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) that they activated ion channels through heating ferritin . For the sake of keeping the argument alive , and to evaluate potential future developments , let us instead suppose that ferritin could be engineered to produce a specific heating rate of ( 17 ) P=30Wg\u00a0of\u00a0metal This is the highest value obtained by filling the ferritin shell with cobalt-doped magnetite ( Fantechi et al . , 2014 ) and thus a generous estimate of what might be accomplished by future engineering of ferritin complexes inside cells . Assuming this specific heating rate , a single ferritin particle with 2400 iron atoms generates heat at a rate of ( 18 ) Q=7\u00d710\u221218W This heat flux will produce a temperature gradient in the surrounding medium ( Figure 2 ) . As Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) state , the temperature indeed decays as the inverse distance r from the particle ( Feynman et al . , 1963 , Ch 12 ) , namely ( 19 ) T ( r ) =Q4\u03c0\u03ba1r where ( 20 ) \u03ba=0 . 61\u00a0Wm\u22c5K is the thermal conductivity of water . Right at the surface of the ferritin sphere the temperature increase is highest , namely ( 21 ) Tferritin=T ( 6\u00a0nm ) =1 . 5\u00d710\u221210K This is a very tiny increase . Activation of a TRPV1 channel requires about 5 K of increase relative to body temperature ( Cao et al . , 2013 ) . So the temperature increase expected , even from a futuristic optimized ferritin , is more than 10 orders of magnitude too small . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17210 . 004Figure 2 . The steady-state temperature profile around a heated sphere in an infinite bath varies inversely with the distance from the center of the sphere . The same argument applies to a ferritin sphere heated from its magnetic core ( top ) and a spherical cell with a large number of heated ferritins on its surface ( bottom ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 17210 . 004 The assumption underlying Equation ( 19 ) is that thermal transport from the magnetic particle to the surrounding medium follows Fourier\u2019s Law , in which the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient . This is a good approximation , as long as the length scales of the problem are large compared to the mean free path of the heat carriers , which are phonons in the current problem . In water , the phonon mean free path is ~0 . 3 nm , about the size of a water molecule ( Rabin , 2002 ) . Indeed , all the relevant dimensions are at least 10-fold larger than that , namely the size of the ferritin particle , the size of the ion channel protein , and the distance from ferritin to ion channel . One therefore expects that non-Fourier heat transport will make only small corrections to the above results , on the order of 10% or less ( Chen , 1996 ) . Another effect resulting from thermal physics at small scales is the thermal resistance to heat flow at the boundary between two materials . A given heat flux across the boundary will produce a discontinuous step in temperature between the two materials . How large is this step for heated nanoparticles ? Ge et al . ( 2004 ) followed thermal transfer between a metal nanoparticle with organic coating and the surrounding water , and observed a thermal conductance of ( 22 ) G=2\u00d7108Wm2\u22c5K , largely independent of particle size . With the heat flux produced by our ferritin particle the resulting temperature step would be ( 23 ) \u0394Tferritin=Q4\u03c0R21G=7\u00d710\u221211K . Again , an exceedingly tiny contribution . It appears that there is no possibility of raising the temperature by several degrees near a single nanoparticle , even if the heating rate were 1000-fold higher . While there have been isolated reports of such magnetic heating effects near synthetic nanoparticles ( Huang et al . , 2010; Riedinger et al . , 2013; Pi\u00f1ol et al . , 2015 ) , they have met a good amount of skepticism . As has been pointed out repeatedly , there is no known physical mechanism for such an effect ( Rabin , 2002; Keblinski et al . , 2006; Gupta et al . , 2010 ) , and it has been suggested that the underlying methods of thermometry should be reevaluated ( Dutz and Hergt , 2013; 2014 ) . Moving on from single-particle heating one may ask whether the many other ferritins expressed on the same cell , though they are at greater distance , might contribute to heating the local environment . Suppose one can express Nferritins=10 , 000\u00a0TRPV1-ferritin complexes on the surface of a spherical cell with rcell=5\u03bcm\u00a0radius . That is about 10-fold the natural expression level in sensory neurons . One can treat the heat production of those 10 , 000 ferritins as distributed evenly over the surface of the cell . Then the temperature gradient outside the cell again follows a 1\/r profile ( Figure 2 ) . At the surface of the cell the resulting temperature increase will be ( 24 ) Tcell=Q\u00a0Nferritins4\u03c0\u00a0\u03ba\u00a0rcell=1 . 7\u00d710\u22129K Unfortunately this is still too low by 9 orders of magnitude . So one cannot achieve activation of single neurons this way , which is of course a central goal of genetically expressed activators . Suppose now that one expresses this number of ferritin-TRPV1 complexes on every neuron in the brain . Would that perhaps be sufficient to heat the entire organ ? At that density , the heating rate per unit mass of brain will be ( 25 ) Pbrain=Q\u00a0Nferritins43\u03c0 rcell31\u03c1brain=1 . 2\u00d710\u22124Wg , where \u03c1brain=1 . 03\u00a0g\/cm3 is the specific density . For comparison , the resting metabolic rate of brain tissue is ~1 . 2\u00d710\u22122\u00a0W\/g , and the resulting heat is carried away and regulated by the processes that keep the organ\u2019s temperature stable . Heating of ferritin throughout the entire brain would therefore contribute only a 1% increase to the heat already being generated from basal activity: this will not overwhelm the homothermic regulation mechanisms sufficiently to open TRPV1 channels . In summary , it seems very unlikely that the effects reported in Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) have anything to do with heating ferritin . The available evidence says that native ferritin produces no measurable magnetic heating at all . Even if we ignore that and assume a generous heating rate , namely the largest reported using a custom metal alloy for the ferritin core , the resulting effects are too small to matter by enormous factors of 1010 ( single-channel activation ) and 109 ( for single-neuron activation ) . \n The calculations presented here evaluate the mechanisms that might underlie recent observations on a molecular compass ( Qin et al . , 2016 ) and neural activation with static magnetic fields ( Wheeler et al . , 2016 ) or high-frequency magnetic fields ( Stanley et al . , 2015 ) . These calculations show that none of the biophysical schemes proposed in these articles is even remotely plausible , and a few additional proposals were eliminated along the way . The forces or torques or temperatures they produce are too small by many orders of magnitude for the desired effects on molecular orientation or on membrane channels . If the phenomena occurred as described , they must rely on some entirely different mechanism . Barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter , the proposed routes to magnetogenetics , based on either pulling or heating a ferritin\/channel complex with magnetic fields , have no chance of success . One does have to ask why none of these authors attempted a back-of-the-envelope estimate to bolster the claims in their papers . Neither , it seems , did the referees who reviewed the manuscripts , nor the authors of three pieces that heralded these articles ( Leibiger and Berggren , 2015; Lewis , 2016; Lohmann , 2016 ) . Why is it important to do so ? First of all , claims that violate the known laws of physics often turn out to be wrong ( Maddox et al . , 1988 ) . There is , of course , always a small chance of discovering new physics , but only if one understands what the old physics predicts and recognizes the discrepancy . If any of the claims in these articles were substantiated \u2013 a room-temperature molecular magnet or measurable forces and heating from ferritin \u2013 their implications for our basic understanding of nanoscale matter would far outweigh their biological significance . More importantly though , calculations are most useful when done ahead of time , to guide the design of experiments . For example , Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) and Wheeler et al . ( 2016 ) evoke an image in which the magnetic field pulls on the ferritin particles . This is possible only if the magnetic field has a strong gradient ( Figure 1a , Equation 10 ) . None of their experiments on animals were designed to produce a strong gradient , nor do the articles report what it was . It is in fact possible to pull on cells that express lots of ferritin , and this has been exploited for magnetic separation ( Owen and Lindsay , 1983 ) . It requires very high magnetic fields , and separation columns with a meshwork of fine steel fibers that produce strong gradients on a microscopic scale . Inserting such a wire mesh into the brain would of course negate the goal of non-invasive control . Two other hypothetical mechanisms for the ferritin effects require a strong field but no gradient . This would be of great experimental value , because a homogeneous magnetic field could then deliver the same control signal throughout an extended volume , like the brain of a mouse . Among these , the dipole interaction between ferritins ( Figure 1b , Equation 14 ) offers little hope . Even with a 100-fold larger field ( 5 T ) , these forces are still 4 log units too small to open a channel . That field strength represents a practical limit: Small movements of the animal , or switching of the field , will cause inductive eddy currents that activate the brain non-specifically , a phenomenon experienced also by MRI subjects ( Schenck et al . , 1992 ) . On the other hand , exploiting anisotropy of the ferritin particle ( Figure 1c , Equation 15 ) may be within range of utility . A 100-fold larger field could produce torque comparable with the thermal energy , which when applied to thousands of channels might have a noticeable effect on membrane currents . To enhance the shape anisotropy of the magnetic particles , perhaps one could engineer the ferritin shell into an elongated shape . More fundamentally , it is clear that the weak effects computed here are a consequence of ferritin\u2019s paramagnetism . A particle with a permanent magnetic moment , such as the magnetosomes made by bacteria ( Bazylinski and Frankel , 2004 ) , could exert much larger forces , torques , and temperatures ( Hergt et al . , 2006 ) , and may offer a physically realistic route to magnetogenetics . With an eye towards such future developments , it is unfortunate that these three questionable claims were published , especially in high-profile journals , because that discourages further innovation . Now that the prize for magnetogenetics has seemingly been taken , what motivates a young scientist to focus on solving the problem for real ? There is an important function here for post-publication peer review: It can make up for pre-publication failures and thus reopen the claimed intellectual space for future pioneers . \n Central to the arguments about magnetogenetics is the proportionality factor \u03be between the magnetic moment m of a single ferritin molecule and the magnetic field B , ( 26 ) m=\u00a0\u03beB . Experimental measurements are usually performed on bulk samples of ferritin and report the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 , defined by ( 27 ) M=\u00a0\u03c7H=\u03c7B\/\u03bc0 , where M is the magnetization of the material , namely the magnetic moment per unit volume , and ( 28 ) \u03bc0=4\u03c0\u00d710\u22127NA2 is the vacuum permeability . Therefore ( 29 ) \u03be=\u03c7\u03c1\u03bc0 , where \u03c1 is the number of ferritin particles per unit volume . In practice , we will see that the reported measurements of magnetization are more often normalized by the iron content of the sample or by the mass , rather than by volume . Then the choice of \u03c1 must be adjusted accordingly . Table 1 summarizes some published measurements on magnetic heating of small nanoparticles with diameter below 10 nm . The loss power per unit mass ( SLP ) depends on the apparatus used for heating . Over the range of conditions considered here , a good approximation is that SLP varies proportionally to the frequency of the alternating magnetic field and to the square of the field strength ( Hergt et al . , 2004 ) . The table therefore corrects all the SLP numbers to the conditions used by Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) : field strength H=B\/\u03bc0=25 . 5kA\/m and frequency f=465kHz . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 17210 . 005Table 1 .

{"lay_summary":"Spoken language is colored by fluctuations in pitch and rhythm . Rather than speaking in a flat monotone , we allow our sentences to rise and fall . We vary the length of syllables , drawing out some , and shortening others . These fluctuations , known as prosody , add emotion to speech and denote punctuation . In written language , we use a comma or a period to signal a boundary between phrases . In speech , we use changes in pitch \u2013 how deep or sharp a voice sounds \u2013 or in the length of syllables . Having more than one type of cue that can signal emotion or transitions between sentences has a number of advantages . It means that people can understand each other even when factors such as background noise obscure one set of cues . It also means that people with impaired sound perception can still understand speech . Those with a condition called congenital amusia , for example , struggle to perceive pitch , but they can compensate for this difficulty by placing greater emphasis on other aspects of speech . Jasmin et al . showed how the brain achieves this by comparing the brain activities of people with and without amusia . Participants were asked to read sentences on a screen where a comma indicated a boundary between two phrases . They then heard two spoken sentences , and had to choose the one that matched the written sentence . The spoken sentences used changes in pitch and\/or syllable duration to signal the position of the comma . This provided listeners with the information needed to distinguish between \"after John runs the race , . . . \" and \"after John runs , the race . . . \" , for example . When two brain regions communicate , they tend to increase their activity at around the same time . The brain regions are then said to show functional connectivity . Jasmin et al . found that compared to healthy volunteers , people with amusia showed less functional connectivity between left hemisphere brain regions that process language and right hemisphere regions that process pitch . In other words , because pitch is a less reliable source of information for people with amusia , they recruit pitch-related brain regions less when processing speech . These results add to our understanding of how brains compensate for impaired perception . This may be useful for understanding the neural basis of compensation in other clinical conditions . It could also help us design bespoke hearing aids or other communication devices , such as computer programs that convert text into speech . Such programs could tailor the pitch and rhythm characteristics of the speech they produce to suit the perception of individual users .","article":"Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing . Accordingly , they downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration . We investigated the neural basis for this strategy . During fMRI , individuals with amusia ( N = 15 ) and controls ( N = 15 ) read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary . They then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and\/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence . Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amusia group between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions , which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners . Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task . Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism . \n Congenital amusia is a rare condition characterized by impaired perception of and memory for pitch ( Peretz et al . , 2002 ) . Although congenital amusia presents as an auditory condition , auditory cortical responses are normal ( Moreau et al . , 2013; Norman-Haignere et al . , 2016 ) , as is subcortical encoding of pitch ( Liu et al . , 2015b ) . The dominant view of amusia\u2019s neural basis is that connectivity between right inferior frontal cortex and right auditory cortex is impaired , resulting in impaired conscious access to pitch information for guiding behavior ( Hyde et al . , 2011; Albouy et al . , 2013; Leveque et al . , 2016; Zendel et al . , 2015; see Peretz , 2016 for review ) . While congenital amusia is believed to be innate , there is evidence that recovery is possible through training ( Whiteford and Oxenham , 2018 ) . Although pitch is usually associated with music , it is also important for cueing categories in spoken language ( de Pijper and Sanderman , 1994; Streeter , 1978 ) and conveying emotion in speech ( Frick , 1985 ) . In highly controlled laboratory tasks in which speech perception judgments must be made based on pitch alone , only minor deficits have been observed in amusia ( Liu et al . , 2015a; Patel et al . , 2008 ) . In naturalistic speech perception contexts , people with amusia rarely report any difficulties ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . This may be because , in natural speech , pitch variation tends to co-occur with variation in other acoustic dimensions , such as duration and amplitude . Our lab has shown that in such cases where multiple redundant cues are available , English-speaking individuals with amusia tend to rely less on pitch than non-amusic controls , suggesting they may calibrate their perception by down-weighting the cues that are less reliable for them ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . As for emotional prosody in speech , individuals with amusia can recognize emotions in spoken sentences , but not in short samples such as isolated vowels ( Pralus et al . , 2019 ) , or when speech has been filtered to remove high-frequency non-pitch cues ( Lolli et al . , 2015 ) . It is unknown how decreased reliance on a particular acoustic cue during speech perception ( such as pitch cues in amusia ) is reflected in the brain . Previous neural studies of cue integration have focused on integration of multiple modalities , for\u00a0example the \u2018weighted connections\u2019 model of multisensory integration . In this model , the relative reliability of the modalities involved with perception of a stimulus is related to differential connectivity strength ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010; Rohe and Noppeney , 2018 ) . For example , when participants simultaneously view and feel touches to the hand , and reliability of visual and tactile perception is manipulated experimentally via introduction of noise , connection strength ( effective connectivity measured with functional MRI and structural equation modeling ) between unimodal and multimodal sensory areas adjusts accordingly . More concretely , when visual information is degraded , the connection strength between lateral occipital cortex ( a visual area ) and intraparietal sulcus ( a multimodal area ) decreases , and when tactile perception is made noisier , connection strength between secondary somatosensory cortex and intraparietal sulcus becomes weaker ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , effective connectivity between the ( multimodal ) superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) and visual and auditory areas has shown similar modulations during processing of audiovisual speech: connection strength between auditory cortex and the STS is weaker when noise has been introduced to the auditory speech , and conversely connection strength between visual cortex and STS is weaker if visual noise is introduced ( Nath and Beauchamp , 2011 ) . Just as connectivity differences have been shown to reflect the precision of different sensory modalities during multisensory integration , an analogous phenomenon may be at work within a single modality during multidimensional integration . As mentioned , the acoustic speech signal carries multiple co-occurring acoustic dimensions ( e . g . roughly described as voice pitch , duration , and amplitude ) , which often provide redundant cues to disambiguate a linguistic category ( Patel , 2014; Winter , 2014; Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . Individuals with typical pitch perception have learned through a lifetime of experience with speech acoustics that vocal pitch is a useful and reliable cue . By contrast , individuals with amusia , who have unreliable perception of and memory for pitch ( analogous to the \u2018noise\u2019 introduced in the multisensory integration studies cited above ) , would have learned that , for them , pitch is not a reliable cue for processing spoken language . Thus , by analogy to the multisensory weighting results described above , we hypothesize that amusics may exhibit decreased connectivity between language regions and pitch-related areas during speech processing . The neural foundations of perceptual weighting in speech have thus far not been investigated in atypical individuals . Indeed , only one previous functional neuroimaging study has examined the neural processing of spoken material in people with amusia . In this study , no group differences were detected in task-related activation or functional connectivity during processing of speech ( whereas group differences were observed during processing of tones; Albouy et al . , 2019 ) . However , the connectivity analyses in this study focused on the silent retention interval in a task in which participants needed to maintain phonemic and not pitch-related information in memory; the analyses also used broader bilateral ROIs within networks associated with language processing . It remains an open question how functional connectivity in amusic and non-amusic participants may differ during speech encoding in pitch-related language tasks within regions of interest selected with a whole-brain data-driven approach . To determine whether the relative reliability of auditory dimensions in speech perception is reflected in functional connectivity , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls . Participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented ones on the basis of the position of intonational phrase boundaries . These intonation changes were conveyed differently , in three conditions: Pitch-Informative ( where only pitch cues could be used to make the judgment ) , Duration-Informative ( where only duration cues could be used ) or Both-Informative ( both pitch and duration cues could be used; Jasmin et al . , 2020a; Jasmin et al . , 2020b ) . Functional connectivity was then examined using a data-driven approach that allowed us to identify the largest group differences , without the need for regions of interest to be selected a priori . The benefit of this approach is that any set of regions could emerge , not only ones reported in previous literature . Crucially , task performance was matched between the groups ( based on prior behavioural testing; Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , ensuring that any neural differences did not simply represent an inability to perform the task . Finally , functional connectivity between these areas was analyzed with respect to prosodic cue weights obtained outside the scanner , and also compared to functional connectivity calculated from different scanning runs with a passive listening task . \n On each trial , participants read one visually presented text sentence , then heard two auditory versions of the sentence , only one of which contained an acoustically conveyed phrase boundary in the same place as in the text sentence ( see Figure 1 for schematic and example sentences ) . Trials were scored as correct if a participant pressed the button associated with the auditory sentence that correctly matched the text sentence . Proportions of correct judgments ( Figure 2 ) were subjected to a repeated-measures analysis of variance . Overall , proportion correct across amusia and control groups was matched ( main effect of Group , F ( 1 , 84 ) = 0 . 16 , p=0 . 69 , interaction of Group by Condition , F ( 2 , 84 ) = 0 . 374 , p=0 . 96 ) . This lack of interaction was predicted based on previous results obtained from a similar paradigm using out-of-scanner data but from the same participants ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . There was a main effect of condition ( F ( 2 , 84 ) = 3 . 32 , p=0 . 04 ) . Follow-up post-hoc testing indicated that performance in the Both-Informative condition ( with pitch and duration cues simultaneously present ) was more accurate than either Pitch-Informative ( t ( 84 ) = 2 . 31 , p=0 . 023 ) or Duration-Informative ( t ( 84 ) = 2 . 15 , p=0 . 03 ) , a result that was also predicted and which replicates the behavioral findings in Jasmin et al . , 2020a . One outlier control participant\u2019s performance was less than 0 . 3 . Re-analysis of the data without this participant did not change the results pattern . Results from these analyses are available online ( see Data Availability Statement for details ) . A data-driven approach was taken to identify brain regions with the largest group- and condition-related differences in functional connectivity ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Comparing whole-brain connectedness values by group ( Amusia vs . Controls ) revealed four significant locations ( where z of peak vertices\u00a0>\u00a04 . 61 , FDR-corrected p<0 . 05 ) that showed greater whole-brain connectedness for the control than for the amusia group ( see Figure 3 , yellow crosses ) . All group differences were located in the inferior frontal cortex: two left hemisphere vertices ( inferior frontal gyrus p . triangularis and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) and two right hemisphere vertices ( inferior frontal gyrus p . triangularis and p . orbitalis ) . There were no areas where whole-brain connectedness differed by Condition , or showed an interaction of Group and Condition . Follow-up testing was conducted on the four significant regions ( Control\u00a0>\u00a0Amusia , collapsed across the three conditions ) identified above to characterize the specific cortical regions driving these group connectivity differences ( Berman et al . , 2016; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019; Song et al . , 2015 ) . Relative to control participants , amusic participants' left inferior frontal gyrus seed region showed particularly notable decreases in connectivity with the right posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal cortex , as well as with the right posterior superior temporal sulcus ( Figure 3A ) . Analysis of subcortical connectivity indicated that there was also weaker connectivity with the right nucleus accumbens ( Table 1 ) . The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in amusic participants showed decreased functional connectivity with the mid portions of the right superior temporal gyrus , posterior part of the right middle temporal gyrus extending into the inferior bank of the superior temporal sulcus , and the right anterior insula ( Figure 3A ) . Several subcortical structures - bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen , bilateral pallidum , bilateral cerebellum , and bilateral thalamus - also showed significantly reduced ( FDR-corrected ) connectivity with the seed in amusics ( Table 1 ) . The right pars triangularis seed showed Control\u00a0>\u00a0Amusic connectivity with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left posterior superior temporal gyrus ( Figure 3B ) . It also showed decreased connectivity with left nucleus accumbens . Right pars orbitalis showed decreased connectivity with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Figure 3B ) . There was also decreased connectivity with the left thalamus ( Table 1 ) . Of the 30 participants in this study , 21 took part in an experiment that measured the degree to which they relied on pitch versus duration to categorize prosody , that\u00a0is , their \u2018normalized prosodic cue weights\u2019 , which ranged from 0 to 1 , with values greater than 0 . 5 indicating greater reliance on pitch than duration , and values less than 0 . 5 indicating greater reliance on duration than pitch ( Experiment 1 , Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . These cue weights were assessed with respect to the functional connectivity results reported above . Across this subset of participants , normalized cue weights were correlated with L-DLPFC\u00a0<=>\u00a0R insula connectivity ( Spearman R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 78 , p=0 . 000037 ) , and L-DLPFC\u00a0<=>\u00a0R auditory\u00a0cortex connectivity ( Spearman R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 75 , p=0 . 000154; Figure 4 ) . This indicated that participants who relied least on pitch information to process speech had the weakest functional connectivity between these areas , while those who relied most on pitch had the strongest . Although analyzing the control and amusic groups independently results in extremely small sample sizes , this pattern also held ( albeit with \u2018marginal significance\u2019 ) within the 11 control participants alone , for both auditory cortex connectivity ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 58 , p=0 . 06 ) and insular connectivity ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 55 , p=0 . 08 ) . Both these correlations were in the predicted direction , suggesting that even non-amusics may perform dimensional reweighting of acoustic dimensions and functional connectivity . Correlations within the ( much more variable ) amusic group alone were weaker and non-significant ( although again , the group size is very small ) . To ensure that\u00a0the pattern of connectivity we observed between groups ( decreased right auditory cortex and right insula with L-DLPFC connectivity ) was not due to intrinsic , task-irrelevant differences in neural architecture , the data from the language task was compared to that collected during passive listening to tone sequences . Whereas during speech perception amusic subjects showed reduced functional connectivity between left frontal and right insula\/auditory ROIs relative to controls ( p=0 . 0001 for both ROIs; in line with the whole-brain imaging analyses ) , this pattern did not hold during passive listening to tones ( Amusia vs Control connectivity , p=0 . 29 , Group ( Amusic , Control ) by Task ( Speech Perception , Passive Tone Listening ) interaction p=0 . 045 for the insula ROI; Amusia vs Control p=0 . 30 , Group by Task interaction p=0 . 035 for the auditory cortex ROI - see Figure 5 ) . These interactions suggest that our neural connectivity results are specifically linked to speech perception , rather than reflecting an overall connectivity difference between groups regardless of task state . Although we were concerned with functional connectivity rather than activation , we also tested for differences in activation levels between groups and conditions . False Discovery Rate correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons across both hemispheres for each test ( Group , Condition and Group X Condition ) . No significant differences were detected for the main effects of group and condition , nor the interaction of those factors . \n We found that individuals with amusia , who have been previously shown to rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , exhibited decreased functional connectivity between left frontal areas and right hemisphere pitch-related regions . In our task , participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented sentences based on pitch , duration , or both these acoustic dimensions together . Using a data-driven approach , we identified four regions in left and right inferior frontal cortex for which the amusic group exhibited decreased functional connectivity with several other sites in frontal , temporal and occipital cortex . The most prominent of these results was decreased connectivity between left frontal regions classically implicated in language processing ( left IFG and DLPFC ) and right hemisphere regions \u2014in the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus , Heschl\u2019s gyrus , and anterior insula\u2014that have been implicated in pitch processing ( Lee et al . , 2011; Garcea et al . , 2017; Warren et al . , 2003; Hohmann et al . , 2018 ) . We suggest that this decreased connectivity between right hemisphere pitch and left hemisphere frontal cortices may relate to the unreliability of the amusics\u2019 perception of and memory for pitch . This is similar to the \u2018weighted connections\u2019 model of multisensory integration , where a more ( or less ) reliable modality is given a stronger ( or weaker ) weight ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010 ) . Congenital amusia is often described as a disorder related to structural and functional connectivity within the right hemisphere , particularly between right inferior frontal cortices and right posterior temporal cortex ( see Peretz , 2016 for review ) . Consistent with this proposal , we found in the present study that right inferior frontal cortex exhibited strongly decreased functional connectivity in the amusia group , and follow-up seed testing revealed that right auditory areas were involved as well . However , we also found that sites in left frontal cortex also showed large decreases in connectivity in amusia , also most prominently with right hemisphere auditory areas . Our results are consistent with an account that right hemisphere auditory areas are not only abnormally connected to right frontal areas ( as observed during tonal tasks ) but are less integrated with frontal left hemisphere regions when processing speech and language . Our null results for group differences in activation during speech processing are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions . For example , the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex has been shown to be similar in participants with amusia and controls ( Norman-Haignere et al . , 2016 ) . Brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is similarly unimpaired in individuals with amusia ( Liu et al . , 2015b ) . Moreover , in oddball EEG paradigms , amusics show similar pre-attentive mismatch negativity responses to small pitch deviants , but impaired attention-dependent P300 responses ( Moreau et al . , 2009; Peretz et al . , 2009; Mignault Goulet et al . , 2012; Moreau et al . , 2013 ) . These findings , along with the fact that amusics show intact non-volitional behavioral responses ( unconscious pitch shifts ) when presented with pitch-altered feedback of their own voice ( Hutchins and Peretz , 2012 ) , have been interpreted as evidence that amusia is a disorder of pitch awareness rather than one of low-level pitch processing ( Peretz et al . , 2009 ) , with differences in structural connectivity as one possible foundation of this putative impaired pitch awareness ( Hyde et al . , 2006; Loui et al . , 2009; but see Chen et al . , 2015 ) . Our interpretation of differences in functional connectivity between amusics and controls diverges somewhat from these previous approaches: we argue that down-weighting of pitch information during perceptual categorization in both speech and music is adaptive , inasmuch as amusics have learned that pitch is an unreliable source of evidence relative to other perceptual dimensions . The evidence above suggesting that encoding of pitch in the brainstem and auditory cortex and pre-attentive responses to pitch changes are unaffected in amusia can be interpreted as suggesting that the fundamental deficit in amusia may not be increased perceptual noise or decreased pitch awareness but difficulties with retention of pitch information in memory ( see Tillmann et al . , 2016 for review ) . Our task arguably taxed working memory resources: in a similar paradigm performed by the same participants in quiet listening conditions ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , the mean reaction time measured from the end of the second auditory stimulus was 1 . 64 s , indicating that participants needed some time to compare both auditory presentations and make their judgments . This interpretation is consistent with evidence suggesting that amusics have difficulty with pitch sequence processing tasks even when discrimination thresholds are accounted for ( Tillmann et al . , 2009 ) , as well as the finding that delaying the time interval between standard and comparison tones exacerbates pitch discrimination impairment in individuals with amusia ( Williamson et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , the pitch awareness account of amusia cannot explain the Jasmin et al . , 2020a finding that pitch cues are downweighted only during longer-scale suprasegmental speech perception , while pitch weighting is not different between amusics and controls during shorter-scale segmental speech perception , despite pitch cues being arguably more subtle in the segmental condition . However , this finding can be explained by the pitch memory account , as the suprasegmental task requires detection of and memory for pitch patterns within a complex sequence , while the segmental task does not . Furthermore , an account of amusia which suggests that the disorder primarily stems from differences in structural connectivity cannot account for the recent finding that functional connectivity patterns do not differ between amusics and controls during a verbal memory task ( Albouy et al . , 2019 ) , as well as our finding that amusics and controls show similar functional connectivity patterns during passive listening to tone sequences . We suggest , therefore , that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable , and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas which integrate information from perceptual regions . One way to test this hypothesis would be to examine functional connectivity during perceptual categorization of consonant-vowel syllables as voiced versus unvoiced based on a pitch cue ( F0 of the following vowel ) and a durational cue ( voice onset time ) . We predict , based on our previous findings ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , that functional connectivity will not differ between amusics and controls on this task , a finding which would not be predicted by the pitch awareness account of amusia . We note that a previous fMRI study on amusia detected group differences in functional connectivity during passive listening to tones . That study used task-defined seed voxels in bilateral auditory cortex and found , in the amusia group , increased connectivity between left and right auditory cortex , but decreased connectivity between right auditory cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus ( Hyde et al . , 2011 ) . The present study does not necessarily clash with these findings , as we used different seed ROIs selected with a different procedure . We did not observe any differences in functional connectivity between conditions in our speech task . This may be because our functional imaging protocol was timed to capture the peak in the BOLD signal corresponding to the presentation of the second auditory stimulus . Participants never knew ( even implicitly ) which acoustic dimension might be useful on any given trial until after they had heard both spoken sentences and needed to compare them to make their response . Furthermore , pitch fluctuations in the stimuli were above participants\u2019 thresholds , even in the Duration-Informative condition ( where the standard deviation of F0 over each spoken utterance was , on average , 2 . 7 semitones ) , and so it is unsurprising that functional connectivity did not change on a trial-by-trial basis , and instead the same \u2018neural strategy\u2019 was employed to process speech regardless of the trial type . Several other future directions are suggested by our results , particularly for examining cue weighting during auditory\/speech perception . In the multimodal integration studies mentioned above ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010; Nath and Beauchamp , 2011 ) , reliability of two different sensory modalities was manipulated experimentally by severely degrading input channels with noise , resulting in changes in connectivity . Similarly , aspects of speech could be selectively masked with noise in order to make them less reliable , which in turn could cause corresponding changes in functional or effective connectivity . Indeed , behavioral work has indicated that when fundamental frequency ( pitch ) or durational aspects of speech are manipulated to be unreliable cues , categorization behavior shifts such that participants place less relative weight on the dimension that has been made less reliable ( Holt and Lotto , 2010 ) . Certain groups , such as tone language speakers , are known to have fine-grained pitch perception abilities , and tend to place greater weight on pitch even when processing speech from a second , non-tonal language that they have learned ( e . g . English; Yu and Andruski , 2010; Zhang and Francis , 2010 , Zhang et al . , 2008; Qin et al . , 2017; Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . Given the increased reliability of their pitch perception , tone language speakers may exhibit correspondingly high connectivity strength between right hemisphere auditory regions and left hemisphere \u2018language regions\u2019 when pitch cues are present ( more so than native non-tonal language speakers ) . Expert musicians also have extensive pitch-related experience and training and could also serve as a population to examine in future work . \n Participants , 15 individuals with amusia ( 10 F , age\u00a0=\u00a060 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 . 4 , range\u00a0=\u00a043\u201374 ) and 15 controls ( 10 F , age\u00a0=\u00a061 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 . 4 , range\u00a0=\u00a038\u201374 ) , were recruited from the UK and were native British English speakers . The amusic group sample size reflected the maximum number of participants that could be screened and tested during our data collection period . The control group sample size was matched to this . All participants gave informed consent , and ethical approval was obtained from the relevant UCL and Birkbeck ethics committees . Amusia status was obtained using the Montreal Battery for the Evaluation of Amusia ( MBEA ) . Participants with a composite score ( summing the Scale , Contour and Interval tests scores ) of 65 or less were classified as having amusia ( Peretz et al . , 2003 ) . We also note that the amusics defined using the MBEA had higher pitch thresholds than controls ( Wilcoxon Rank Sum W\u00a0=\u00a029 , p=0 . 001 ) but did not differ from controls in tone duration discrimination ( W\u00a0=\u00a0129 , p=0 . 74 ) , speech-in-noise threshold ( W\u00a0=\u00a0155 . 5 , p=0 . 17 ) , or audiometric hearing thresholds ( t ( 28 ) = 1 . 33 , p=0 . 20; see Jasmin et al . , 2020a for detailed methods for these procedures ) . The stimuli were 42 compound sentences that consisted of a pre-posed subordinate clause followed by a main clause ( see Figure 1 for an example , and Jasmin et al . , 2020a , Jasmin et al . , 2020b for details ) . There were two versions of each sentence: ( 1 ) an \u2018early closure\u2019 version , where the verb of the subordinate clause was used intransitively and the following noun was the subject of a new clause [\u2018After Jane dusts , the dining table [is clean]\u201d]; and ( 2 ) , \u2018late closure\u2019 , where the verb was transitive and took the following noun as its object , moving the phrase boundary to a slightly later position in the sentence [\u2018After Jane dusts the dining table , [it is clean]\u201d] . The words in both versions of the sentence were identical from the start of the sentence until the end of the second noun ( \u2018After Jane dusts the dining table \u2026\u201d ) , and only the lexically identical portions of the sentences were presented to participants; thus the two stimuli did not differ in words spoken . A native British English speaking male ( who had previously trained as an actor ) recorded early closure and late closure versions of each sentence in a sound-proofed room . The recordings were cropped such that only the portions with the same words remained , and silent pauses after phrase breaks were removed . Synthesized versions of these sentences were created with STRAIGHT voice-morphing software ( Kawahara and Irino , 2005 ) . First , the two versions of the sentence were manually time-aligned by marking corresponding \u2018anchor points\u2019 in the two recordings . Then , morphed speech was synthesized by varying the degree to which the early closure and late closure recordings contributed duration and pitch information . We synthesized pairs of stimuli in three conditions: ( 1 ) In the Pitch-Informative condition , the stimulus pair had exactly the same durational properties ( that is , the length of phonemes , syllables , and words was the average between the two original recordings ) but the vocal pitch indicated early or late closure at a morphing level of 80%; ( 2 ) in the Duration-Informative condition , vocal pitch in the stimulus pair was identical ( at 50% between both versions ) but the durational characteristics indicated early or late closure at a morphing level of 80%; ( 3 ) in the Both-Informative condition , both pitch and time cued early or late closure simultaneously at 80% . The morphed speech varied only in duration and pitch , while all other aspects of the acoustics ( such as amplitude and spectral characteristics other than pitch ) were the same , held constant at 50% between the two original recordings during morphing . This stimulus set is freely available ( Jasmin et al . , 2020b ) . Across all stimuli , F0 ( vocal pitch ) differences between early and late closure versions were large , with a mean of maximum difference of 7 . 7 semitones and range of 4 . 0\u201312 . 6 semitones . Thus , even the stimulus pair with the smallest pitch difference ( 4 . 0 semitones ) exceeded the\u00a0~1 . 5 semitone pitch change detection threshold of the \u2018most impaired\u2019 participant in the amusia group ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , which increased the chances that the amusia group would not suffer from poor performance , thereby avoiding a performance-related confound with our experimental design ( see Church et al . , 2010 for discussion ) . Subjects were scanned with a Siemens Avanto 1 . 5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner with a 32-channel head coil , with sounds presented via Sensimetrics S14 earbuds , padded around the ear with NoMoCo memory foam cushions . Functional data were collected using a slow event-related design with sparse temporal sampling to allow presentation of auditory stimuli in quiet . We used an echo planar image sequence , with 40 slices , slice time 85 ms , slab tilted to capture the entire cerebrum and dorsal cerebellum , ascending sequential acquisition; 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 mm voxel size; silent stimulus and response period\u00a0=\u00a08 . 7 s , volume acquisition time\u00a0=\u00a03 . 4 s , total inter-trial interval\u00a0=\u00a012 . 1 s , flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090 degrees , bandwidth\u00a0=\u00a02298 Hz\/pixel , echo time ( TE ) =\u00a050 ms . After collecting functional runs , a high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan was collected ( MPRAGE , 176 slices , sagittal acquisition , 2x GRAPPA acceleration , 1 mm isotropic voxels , acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a0224\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 ) . Each run began with three dummy scans to allow magnetic stabilization . Each trial ( repetition time ) lasted 12 . 1 s . The start of each trial was triggered by a pulse corresponding to the start of a volume acquisition ( which acquired neural data from the previous trial , at a delay ) . At t\u00a0=\u00a01 s into the trial , the sentence appeared on the screen; before scanning participants were instructed to read each sentence silently to themselves . At t\u00a0=\u00a05 s ( plus or minus a random 100 ms jitter ) participants heard a spoken version of the first part of the sentence . At t\u00a0=\u00a07 . 4 s ( plus or minus 100 ms jitter ) the second version was presented . The two spoken versions contained the same words but their pitch and\/or timing characteristics cued a phrase boundary that occurred earlier or later in the sentence . Following this , there were approximately 2 s of silence during which the participant responded with the button box , before the scanner began acquiring the next volume at t\u00a0=\u00a012 . 1 s . Participants performed three blocks of 42 trials ( 14 each of Pitch-Informative , Duration-Informative , and Both-Informative ) with 8 Rest trials interspersed within each block . Following data collection for this task and the structural scan , participants took part in two task-free fMRI scanning runs in which they watched a silent film ( The General , starring Buster Keaton , or an episode of the Planet Earth series played without sound ) while being presented auditorily with semi-random tone sequences . Stimuli consisted of sequences of \u2018pips\u2019 - 30 ms 6-harmonic complex tones . The fundamental frequencies of the pips were either 440 , 466 . 16 , 493 . 88 or 523 . 25 Hz , and the time between tone onsets was 0 . 075 , 0 . 125 , 0 . 175 , or 0 . 225 s . The transition probabilities ( determining whether pip N+1 had the same pitch or duration properties as pitch N ) were set at either 0 . 1 and 0 . 9 for duration and either 0 . 3 and 0 . 7 for pitch . These two transition parameters were \u2018crossed\u2019 to create four design cells , and 25 random sequences were generated for each cell . MRI scanning parameters were identical to those used in the active , prosody task , except the time between volume acquisitions was 17 . 1 s . Participants listened to 100 tone sequences across two runs ( 50 per run ) . Matlab code used to create the stimuli can be found online ( see Data Availability Statement ) . Image preprocessing was performed with FreeSurfer 6 . 0 . 0 ( Fischl , 2012 ) and AFNI-SUMA 18 . 1 . 18 ( Cox , 1996 ) . Anatomical images were registered to the third echo planar image of the first run using Freesurfer\u2019s bbregister and processed with FreeSurfer\u2019s automated pipeline for segmenting tissue types , generating cortical surface models , and parcellating subcortical structures . Masks of inferior colliculi were obtained by manually examining individual subjects\u2019 anatomical images and selecting a single EPI voxel located at its centre , bilaterally . Freesurfer cortical surface models were imported to AFNI with the @SUMA_Make_Spec_FS program . Then a standard pre-processing pipeline using AFNI\u2019s afniproc . py program was used: all echo planar image volumes were aligned to the third repetition time of the first run using AFNI\u2019s 3DAllineate , intersected with the cortical surface with SUMA , smoothed along the surface with a 2D 6-mm-FWHM kernel , and converted to a standard mesh ( std . 141 ) for group analyses , separately for each hemisphere , where each vertex in the mesh ( 198812 per hemisphere ) is aligned to the 'same' location in the cortex across subjects , using curvature-based morphing . Preprocessing of the passive listening experiment data was identical . The magnitude of transient head motion was calculated from the six motion parameters obtained during image realignment and aggregated as a single variable using AFNI's @1dDiffMag to calculate a Motion Index ( Berman et al . , 2016; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019 ) . This measure is similar to average Frame Displacement over a scan ( Power et al . , 2012 ) and is in units of mm per repetition time . The difference in average motion between the groups was small ( amusia group mean motion\u00a0=\u00a00 . 31 mm\/TR; control group mean\u00a0=\u00a00 . 28 mm\/TR ) and amounted to 32 micrometers ( ~1\/30th of a millimeter ) per TR . The mean and distribution of motion did not differ statistically between groups ( two sample t-test p=0 . 70 , two-tailed ) . Given the previous reports ( described above ) of changes in connection strength between unimodal and multimodal areas in response to noise ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010; Nath and Beauchamp , 2011 ) , we chose a connectivity-based analysis approach for our study . Beta series correlation ( Rissman et al . , 2004 ) is a technique for examining functional connectivity and its modulation by task , using correlations in trial-by-trial responses . It has been shown to be more powerful than alternatives such as generalized psycho-physiological interaction ( gPPI ) for event-related designs ( Cisler et al . , 2014 ) . In a beta series analysis , one beta weight is calculated for each trial in the experiment ( rather than for each condition ) . All the trial-wise betas associated with a given condition are then serially ordered to form a \u2018beta series\u2019 . Finally , using the beta series in the same way as a standard BOLD fMRI time series , functional connectivity ( measured as Pearson correlations ) is calculated between seed regions of interest and the rest of the brain . Differences in functional connectivity can then be examined by comparing groups , comparing conditions , or examining the interaction of these factors . Our experiment used a slow event-related design with a long repetition time ( 12 . 1 s ) and sparse temporal sampling ( with volume acquisition separated by silent periods ) . Therefore , the time between acquisitions was long enough for the haemodynamic response to return to baseline , and each echo planar image acquisition corresponded to exactly one trial ( Figure 1 ) . For this reason , we did not convolve the echo planar image time series with a basis function during subject-level statistical analysis ( Hall et al . , 1999 ) . In the design matrix for obtaining trial-wise betas , 126 column regressors were used ( one for each non-rest trial ) . Each column vector was of length 150 ( corresponding to all trials , including rest trials ) and had a single \u2018one\u2019 in the position where the trial associated with that column occurred , while zeros were located in every other position . Polynomials up to second degree were also included in the model , on a run-wise basis , to remove the mean and any linear or quadratic trends . Fitting the trial regressors on a subject-wise basis resulted in cortical surface models of beta weights for each of the 126 trials , at each vertex on the reduced-vertex icosahedral cortical surface , with beta weights reflecting the neural response associated with that trial . As noted above , trial-wise betas were then serially ordered to form beta series separately for each of the three experimental conditions ( Pitch-Informative , Duration-Informative , and Both-Informative ) ( Rissman et al . , 2004 ) . Because there were 30 participants , this procedure resulted in a total of 90 beta series ( 30 participants\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 conditions=90 beta series ) . As for the passive tone listening data , because all \u2018trials\u2019 were of the same type , it was not necessary to separate them into conditions and perform a first-level model to obtain betas . However , polynomials up to second degree were detrended from the pre-processed data ( as was done with the task data ) . Beta series analysis requires initial seed voxels , vertices , or regions to be identified , whose trial-to-trial changes in activity are then compared to those of the rest of the brain . Rather than choose a priori seeds derived from the literature , which used mainly musical tasks or resting state , we used a data-driven approach to search for the largest group and condition differences in functional connectivity ( Berman et al . , 2016; Cole et al . , 2010; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019; Meoded et al . , 2015; Song et al . , 2015; Steel et al . , 2016; Stoddard et al . , 2016; Watsky et al . , 2018 ) . To do this , we first calculated the \u2018whole-brain connectedness\u2019 of each cortical vertex ( a procedure available in AFNI as the 3dTCorrMap function ) . The whole-brain connectedness of a given vertex is defined as the Pearson correlation of activity within that vertex\/voxel and the average signal across all neural gray matter in the rest of the brain . Mathematically , this is equivalent to calculating thousands of Pearson correlations , of a given vertex\/voxel series and every other vertex\/voxel series in the brain , and then taking the mean of those correlations ( Cole et al . , 2010 ) , then repeating the process for every individual voxel\/vertex . As such , it represents the global connectedness ( or \u2018global correlation\u2019 ) of a vertex\/voxel . To calculate whole-brain connectedness , first , the average of trial-wise betas in gray matter across the brain was calculated in volume space , separately for each subject and for each condition , by running first-level ( subject ) models . The statistical models were identical to those conducted on the cortical surface , described above , but were performed on volumetric Talairach images instead of the cortical surfaces . The reason for this choice was so that voxels in cortex and subcortex would contribute equally to our measure of global ( whole-brain ) connectivity . First , the\u00a0average gray-matter beta value was calculated for each trial by intersecting each image in the beta series with a whole-brain gray matter mask ( which excluded white matter and ventricles ) and calculating the average beta value within the mask ( Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019 ) . Next , this gray matter average was correlated with each cortical surface vertex\u2019s beta series , separately for each subject and condition , to obtain whole-brain connectedness maps . These values were then subjected to a statistical analysis based on our 2 ( Group ) \u00d7\u00a03 ( Condition ) experimental design . Linear mixed effects models ( AFNI\u2019s 3dLME ) ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) were constructed whose dependent variables were the vertex-wise whole-brain connectedness maps from each beta series . Group and Condition and their interaction were included as fixed effects . Participant was treated as a random intercept . Results of this step were corrected vertex-wise for multiple comparisons with False Discovery Rate ( q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) , separately for each test ( Main Effect of Group; Main Effect of Condition; Interaction of Group by Condition ) by pooling the p-values from both hemispheres\u2019 cortical surfaces . This False Discovery Rate threshold corresponded to uncorrected p<4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 for the Main Effect of Group . Four significant results ( contiguous significant vertices ) survived this threshold and were taken forward for the next analysis step . For the Main Effect of Condition and Interaction of Condition x Group , no results survived statistical correction at\u00a0FDR ( q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) . An analogous procedure was run on the passive tone listening data , in which whole-brain connectedness values were compared by group ( amusic vs . control ) in a linear mixed effects model . No significant FDR-corrected group differences were detected , nor at a reasonable uncorrected threshold of p<0 . 001 . A similar procedure was performed for subcortical structures . Beta series were obtained for each subject , structure , and experimental condition , from their standard Freesurfer subcortical parcellations by masking the EPI data within each structure and calculating the average of the voxels . Each structure\u2019s beta series was then correlated with the whole-brain gray matter beta average , separately for each condition , and the resulting values were subjected to linear mixed effects models with the same factors as above . Tests for Main Effect of Condition , of Group , and the Interaction of these factors was performed . All p-values were greater than p>0 . 001 and no results survived an FDR-correction calculated over them . The first analysis step ( seed definition , described above ) identified which , if any , brain areas showed the largest connectivity differences between groups . However , this step is insufficient to localize the other specific regions driving this pattern . An analogy is in Analysis of Variance , where a significant omnibus test indicates a difference exists , but follow-up testing is required to determine where in the model differences exist ( Gotts et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , to locate the regions driving this pattern , we undertook a second step: follow-up seed-to-whole-brain testing ( Cole et al . , 2010; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019 ) . Each seed region was examined with respect to its connectivity pattern with every cortical vertex and subcortical structure . For each of the 90 beta series ( 30 subjects by three conditions ) , values within the seed vertices were averaged and then correlated with the beta series for every vertex in the brain . These correlations were Fisher Z-transformed and used as the dependent variables in linear mixed effects models ( 3dLME ) with the same fixed and random effects as above . For each of the seeds , we tested for the group difference ( Amusia vs Control ) in connectivity . Results were False Discovery Rate corrected to ( q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) across all eight follow-up tests [four seeds\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 hemispheres] corresponding to a threshold of p<0 . 00035 . Similarly , for the subcortical structures , each seed beta series was correlated with subcortical structure beta series , with resulting values subject to statistical testing . An FDR correction over all tests involving subcortex was applied . For display in figures , the data were converted from SUMA\u2019s standard mesh ( std . 141 ) to Freesurfer\u2019s standard surface ( fsaverage ) using AFNI\u2019s SurfToSurf program and mapping values from the closest nodes ( i . e . vertices ) . To determine whether the functional connectivity patterns we observed were related to the importance placed on acoustic dimensions during prosodic categorization ( cue weighting ) , the functional connectivity results were analyzed with respect to previously acquired cue weights obtained behaviorally from a subset of participants ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . The right anterior insula and right auditory cortex results were used as ROIs ( Figure 3A ) . The beta series for each ROI ( averaged across vertices ) was correlated with the beta series within the L-DLPFC seed area , separately for each condition , then averaged and Fisher Z-transformed . For the 21 participants for whom we had prosodic cue weight data ( from Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , these cue weights were analyzed with respect to the functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC seed and the two ROIs using Spearman correlations . As described above , functional connectivity between L-DLPFC , and right auditory cortex and right insula was calculated using data from the passive tone listening task , using ROIs derived from the active speech perception task . After pre-processing and de-trending , the averaged value from the tone listening experiment within these ROIs was extracted , as well as the LDLPFC seed , for each experiment . Correlations between signal within the seed and the two ROIs was calculated and Fisher Z-transformed . As mentioned above , because all trials in the tone-listening experiment were analyzed as the same type , it was not necessary to use a first-level model to obtain trial-wise betas . Similarly for the data from the speech task , the average value within the seed region and both ROIs was extracted , separately for each of the 3 Beta series ( Pitch- , Time- and Both-Informative ) , and the seed and ROI series were correlated . The mean of these three correlation coefficients was calculated and Fisher Z-transformed . Finally , statistics were performed using a mixed ANOVA with Experiment ( Speech or Tones ) as the within-subject factor and Group ( Amusia or Control ) as the between-subject factor . A standard General Linear Model comparing activation strength ( rather than connectivity ) was also conducted . As in the General Linear Model for obtaining beta weights , no basis function was used , and polynomials up to second degree were included in the models . The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in the Birkbeck repository ( https:\/\/researchdata . bbk . ac . uk\/65\/ ) , as are the speech stimuli ( Jasmin et al . , 2020b; https:\/\/researchdata . bbk . ac . uk\/37\/ ) .

{"lay_summary":"The cells of nearly all organisms need iron as this metal plays an important role in a wide range of biological processes . However , iron can also trigger the formation of harmful molecules that can damage cells . It is therefore crucial that the amount of iron in cells is tightly controlled and that any extra iron is safely stored away . Most of the iron in the body is stored within a protein called ferritin , which is then broken down to release iron as it is needed , in a process known as ferritinophagy . Cells use several systems to break down proteins , one of which , called autophagy , has been linked to ferritinophagy . During autophagy , a bubble-like structure called an autophagosome engulfs proteins that need to be removed and delivers them to a compartment in the cell where they can be broken down . In 2014 , researchers showed that a protein called NCOA4 on the surface of autophagosomes targets ferritin for destruction . When iron levels are high in the cell , the amount of NCOA4 on the autophagosomes is low . This leads to fewer ferritin molecules being broken down . In contrast , low iron levels lead to an increase of NCOA4 on autophagosomes , which promotes ferritinophagy and increases the amount of iron in the cell . Now , Mancias , Vaites et al\u2014including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 work\u2014investigate the role of NCOA4 in ferritinophagy in more detail . Biochemical experiments revealed that a region of NCOA4 directly interacts with a particular subunit of ferritin and this interaction is necessary to deliver ferritin to autophagosomes . Mancias , Vaites et al . then used laboratory grown-cells to investigate why the amount of NCOA4 changes in response to the amount of iron in the cell . The experiments show the amount of NCOA4 varies depending on whether it interacts with another protein called HERC2 , which targets proteins for destruction by a structure called the proteasome . HERC2 only binds to NCOA4 when iron levels are high , which leads to NCOA4 being broken down by the proteasome . When iron levels are low , HERC2 does not interact with NCOA4 . The presence of more NCOA4 then leads to more ferritinophagy , and so increases the amount of iron in the cell . Mancias , Vaites et al . also found that red blood cells , which depend highly on iron , do not develop properly in zebrafish that have lower amounts of the NCOA4 protein . Further work is needed to see whether NCOA4 is also important for the development of other cells and tissues .","article":"NCOA4 is a selective cargo receptor for the autophagic turnover of ferritin , a process critical for regulation of intracellular iron bioavailability . However , how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood . Through analysis of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction , we demonstrate that direct association via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes . Moreover , NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system . Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase . In zebrafish and cultured cells , NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation . This work reveals the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting . \n Iron is essential for the survival of nearly all organisms as it serves as a cofactor for a host of biochemical processes including oxygen storage , oxidative phosphorylation , and enzymatic reactions required for cellular proliferation ( Pantopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . However , the levels of free iron in a cell must be tightly controlled to avoid the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) via the Fenton reaction ( Dixon and Stockwell , 2014 ) . As such , iron metabolism is a tightly regulated process controlled by a network of iron-dependent proteins ( Pantopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . The cell has evolved mechanisms whereby iron can be sequestered and released from protein complexes in response to changing iron levels ( Anderson et al . , 2012 ) . One such protein is ferritin , which forms a complex of 24 subunits ( consisting of a mixture of ferritin heavy and light chains , FTH1 and FTL , respectively ) capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms ( Arosio et al . , 2009 ) . When iron levels in the cell are low , ferritin is degraded allowing the release of iron for use by the cell . Ferritin is degraded in the lysosome and recent evidence implicated autophagy , a conserved catabolic cellular pathway , in the \u2018ferritinophagy\u2019 process ( Radisky and Kaplan , 1998; Asano et al . , 2011 ) . Through quantitative proteomic analysis of purified autophagosomes , we recently identified NCOA4 as the selective autophagy receptor that targets ferritin to the autophagosome , providing the first mechanistic explanation of how ferritinophagy occurs ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . We further showed that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is important for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis . NCOA4 was subsequently identified as an ubiquitylation target when the VPS34 autophagy activator is inhibited and also was found to promote ferritinophagy ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) . Three central questions emerge from this work . First , what molecular determinants drive the pathway and are the interactions between NCOA4 and ferritin direct ? Interestingly , NCOA4 has been reported to bind FTH1 , but not FTL , in cell extracts ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) ; however , the biochemical basis of this specificity is unclear , especially given that FTH1 and FTL are 53% identical and 66% similar in primary sequence . In most cell types , ferritin complexes are composed of both heavy and light chains . The identification of point mutants that specifically abolish these interactions could facilitate a further dissection of NCOA4 function . Second , given that NCOA4 levels appear to control flux through the ferritinophagy pathway , what mechanisms control the abundance of NCOA4 ? We previously reported that NCOA4 levels are altered by intracellular iron status ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) ; when iron levels are high , NCOA4 abundance is low , thereby promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture . But when iron is low , NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy . However , our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these processes is limited and is complicated by the fact that the pool of NCOA4 participating in targeting ferritin to autophagosomes is apparently degraded within lysosomes . Thus , understanding the mechanisms that control NCOA4 abundance could help unravel the physiological underpinnings of flux through the ferritinophagy pathway , with implications for understanding iron utilization . Our recent work revealed HERC2 , a large multi-domain homologous to E6AP carboxy terminus ( HECT ) E3 ubiquitin ligase , as an NCOA4-interacting protein ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . HERC2 is reported to associate with numerous proteins and likely has multiple ubiquitylation targets , including E6AP and proteins linked to DNA damage ( Bekker-Jensen et al . , 2010; Martinez-Noel et al . , 2012; Moroishi et al . , 2014; Galligan et al . , 2015 ) . Intriguingly , HERC2 associates with the SCFFBLX5 ubiquitin ligase ( Tan et al . , 2013 ) and has recently been implicated in the basal turnover of FBXL5 ( Moroishi et al . , 2014 ) , a key iron-sensing protein that promotes turnover of the ferritin translational repressor IRP2 ( Iron Regulatory Protein 2 , also known as IREB2 ) when iron is high ( Salahudeen et al . , 2009; Vashisht et al . , 2009 ) . However , the precise role that HERC2 , iron , and the ubiquitin system play in regulating NCOA4 , and how this is related to NCOA4 autophagic turnover during ferritinophagy remains unexplored . Third , what is the physiological role of NCOA4 in cellular processes that are highly dependent upon iron availability ? Initial links between NCOA4 and processes with a requirement for high iron availability come from expression studies where ncoa4 mRNA is high at sites of erythropoiesis during zebrafish development ( Weber et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , recent transcriptomic analysis shows significant upregulation of NCOA4 at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation in humans , the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis , a highly iron dependent process ( An et al . , 2014 ) . Prior studies have demonstrated defects in erythroid differentiation upon deletion of canonical autophagy genes ( Cao et al . , 2015 ) ; however , these studies focused on an inability to clear mitochondria during erythroid maturation due to dysfunctional mitophagy ( Mortensen et al . , 2010; Li-Harms et al . , 2015 ) . While it is clear that iron obtained via holo-transferrin endocytosis is used for heme synthesis during erythroid differentiation , there is debate as to the intracellular itinerary of this iron once liberated from transferrin ( Lane et al . , 2015 ) . There is evidence that transferrin-liberated endosomal iron is transferred directly to mitochondria ( Sheftel et al . , 2007 ) ; however , additional studies show that ferritin-sequestered iron is also utilized for heme synthesis ( Vaisman et al . , 1997 ) . Here , we use in-depth biochemical and cell culture studies , as well as the zebrafish system to dissect the roles of NCOA4 , Ferritin , and HERC2 in mediating ferritinophagy and the role of ferritinophagy in erythropoiesis . We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with FTH1 via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1 . Mutation at these binding sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinophagy . We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its \u2018CUL7-homology domain\u2019 to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system , thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture . Surprisingly , we find that this same C-terminal domain within NCOA4 binds iron and the iron-bound state of NCOA4 determines HERC2 binding , suggesting an iron-dependent switch in NCOA4 turnover . Finally , we show that NCOA4 is important for erythropoiesis in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for use in heme synthesis . This study establishes the importance of NCOA4 as a critical regulator of cellular and organismal iron metabolism and reveals the mechanistic underpinnings of its iron-dependent regulation . \n There is little structural information available for NCOA4 apart from predicted coiled coil domains at the N-terminus . While NCOA4 orthologs exist throughout metazoans , there is minimal sequence homology within the proteome . Sequence alignment , secondary structure prediction , and tertiary structure prediction were used to design NCOA4 fragments for identification of the ferritin-binding domain ( Figure 1A ) . The N-terminus of NCOA4 consists of predicted coiled coil domains that have been previously shown to mediate oligomerization of NCOA4 ( Monaco et al . , 2001 ) . This domain is present in both NCOA4 splice variants , encoding a 614-residue \u03b1 isoform and a 287-residue \u03b2 isoform ( Alen et al . , 1999 ) . We therefore tested binding of purified apoferritin from horse spleen ( containing both FTH1 and FTL ) in vitro to recombinant full-length Myc-tagged NCOA4\u03b1 , NCOA4\u03b2 ( to rule out a folded motif consisting of the N-terminus and a short portion of the C-terminus ) , NCOA4-N-terminus ( NCOA41\u2212245 ) , and NCOA4-C-terminus ( NCOA4235\u2212614 ) . Ferritin associated with both NCOA4\u03b1 and the NCOA4 C-terminal fragment but not with NCOA4\u03b2 or the NCOA4 N-terminal fragment ( Figure 1B ) . Further truncation constructs were designed based on secondary structure prediction and ferritin binding in vitro was mapped to NCOA4 amino acids 383\u2013522 ( NCOA4383\u2212522 , Figure 1A , C , D ) . This portion of NCOA4 is predicted to contain four \u03b1-helices and constitutes a discrete sub-domain of NCOA4 not present in NCOA4\u03b2 . To determine if a discrete portion of this region binds ferritin , we made further truncation constructs and demonstrated binding to amino acids 475\u2013522 ( Figure 1C , D ) . There was a significant loss of binding efficiency to ferritin when further truncation constructs were tested; however , residual binding was seen with amino acids 485\u2013509 ( Figure 1D , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Given the overlapping nature of truncation constructs in this experiment , we tested whether deletion of amino acids 490\u2013499 within the NCOA4383\u2212522 construct affected binding in vitro . This construct completely abrogated binding ( Figure 1F ) . Alanine scanning mutagenesis across this region identified W497 and to a lesser extent I489 , S492 , L494 , and L498 as important residues for ferritin binding ( Figure 1E , F ) . Mutation of I489 and W497 ( NCOA4I489\/W497A ) in the context of NCOA4383\u2212522 abrogated binding to ferritin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Thus , NCOA4 associates directly with ferritin in vitro and employs sequences in a predicted helical domain for this interaction . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 003Figure 1 .

FTH1\/LAMP2 localization was visualized by confocal microscopy . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 004 We next examined the ability of NCOA4I489A\/W497A to bind endogenous ferritin in HCT116 cells and evaluated whether mutant NCOA4 was capable of facilitating ferritin delivery to lysosomes upon iron depletion . Because dimerization with endogenous NCOA4 could confound analysis of mutants , we utilized CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated genome editing ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) to engineer NCOA4-deficient clonal HCT116 cell lines . Two independent clones were obtained and analyzed for NCOA4 protein expression ( Figure 1G ) . To determine whether mutant NCOA4 binds ferritin in cells , we stably expressed C-terminally tagged ( CTAP ) wild type or NCOA4I489A\/W497A in control or NCOA4-deficient HCT116 cells , followed by FLAG affinity purification to purify tagged NCOA4 . Consistent with in vitro data , ferritin binding to NCOA4I489A\/W497A ( as monitored by FTH1 immunoblotting ) is abrogated in NCOA4-deficient cells , and a significant reduction in binding to ferritin is observed in control cells expressing endogenous NCOA4 , apparently reflecting oligomerization of ectopically expressed NCOA4I489A\/W497A with endogenous NCOA4 present in the immune complex ( Figure 1H ) . Given that NCOA4I489A\/W497A displayed a dramatic decrease in ferritin binding when expressed in cells , we next evaluated whether cells expressing this mutant undergo ferritinophagy upon iron depletion . Control or NCOA4-deficient cells stably expressing wild type or NCOA4I489A\/W497A were loaded with ferric ammonium citrate ( FAC ) for 14 hr , followed by iron chelation using deferoxamine ( DFO ) for 6 hr in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors . While NCOA4-deficient cells expressing wild type NCOA4 exhibit punctate lysosomal ferritin localization as shown previously ( Dowdle et al . , 2014; Mancias et al . , 2014 ) cells expressing NCOA4I489A\/W497A exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic ferritin staining , indicating defective ferritinophagy in the presence of mutant NCOA4 ( Figure 1I , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Our data indicates that NCOA4383\u2212522 , including hydrophobic residues I489 and W497 , is required for association with ferritin and productive ferritinophagy in cells . Ferritin complexes in vivo are composed of 24 subunits of FTH1 and FTL , with varying ratios depending on the cell type . We initially identified both FTH1 and FTL as binding partners of NCOA4 and confirmed a reciprocal interaction by FTH1 pulldown ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . While Dowdle et al . recently showed that NCOA4 appears to selectively recognize the FTH1 subunit of ferritin in vivo ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) , it remains unclear whether the NCOA4-ferritin interaction occurs in a direct manner or requires intermediate factors for binding . While the above experiments with purified ferritin from horse spleen and recombinant NCOA4 suggested a direct interaction , we subsequently produced recombinant FTH1-only and FTL-only ferritin complexes and tested for direct interactions with recombinant NCOA4 . NCOA4 specifically recognizes recombinant FTH1 , confirming the prior specificity and also demonstrating that NCOA4 recognizes FTH1 directly ( Figure 2A ) . As NCOA4 interacts with the 450 kDa ferritin complex ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) , we predicted that NCOA4 binds to the surface of ferritin and that differences in FTH1 vs FTL surface residues dictate NCOA4 specificity for FTH1 . We identified 16 FTH1 surface residues that were conserved among FTH1 orthologs but not FTL ( Figure 2B ) ( Lawson et al . , 1991; Hempstead et al . , 1997 ) . We performed alanine mutagenesis of these 16 residues individually , expressed them recombinantly in Escherichia coli , purified 450 kDa complexes for all mutants as determined by gel filtration analysis , and tested binding to NCOA4 in NCOA4-GST pulldowns . Critically , FTH1R23A mutation abrogated binding to NCOA4383\u2212522 but none of the other residues tested had a negative effect on NCOA4-FTH1 binding in these assays ( Figure 2C ) .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 006 To determine whether FTH1 R23 is required to support NCOA4 association with ferritin complexes in cells , we first generated FTH1-deficient cells using CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated genome editing . Three independent FTH1-deficient HCT116 cell lines were obtained , as evidenced by loss of FTH1 protein expression and PCR genotyping ( Figure 2D , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . We stably expressed N-terminally FLAG-HA tagged ( NTAP ) wild type and FTH1R23A in control or FTH1-deficient HCT116 cells , followed by FLAG affinity purification to isolate FLAG-FTH1 complexes and examine endogenous NCOA4 binding . While FTH1R23A is unable to associate with NCOA4 , binding to FTL is maintained , indicating that mutant FTH1 is capable of forming FTH\/FTL complexes ( Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Moreover , GFP-FTH1R23A expressed in FTH1-deficient cells fails to localize to punctate lysosomal structures , consistent with an inability to bind the NCOA4 cargo receptor ( Figure 2F ) . Thus , binding of NCOA4 to FTH1 involves a basic residue located on the surface of the complex but not present in FTL . Our previous work revealed that NCOA4 delivers ferritin complexes to the autophagosome for degradation ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . Since aberrant degradation of ferritin in lysosomes would be deleterious to the cell when intracellular iron is high , we next sought to elucidate the mechanism whereby cells suppress NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy under iron-replete conditions . We previously noted that NCOA4 levels are altered by iron status; when iron is high , NCOA4 abundance is low thereby promoting ferritin accumulation , and when iron is low , NCOA4 levels are high , thereby promoting ferritinophagy ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . We noted that previous interaction proteomics revealed the large HECT E3 ligase HERC2 as a high confidence NCOA4 interacting protein ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . We hypothesized that HERC2 may regulate NCOA4 levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system . Indeed , previous proteomics experiments identified multiple ubiquitylation sites on NCOA4 ( Kim et al . , 2011; Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) . We further reasoned that the iron-dependent regulation of NCOA4 levels may be a result of iron-dependent recognition of NCOA4 by HERC2 . Therefore we first examined the binding of endogenous HERC2 to NCOA4 in cells under iron replete and deficient conditions . Cells were treated with iron chelator ( DFO ) , or loaded with excess iron ( FAC ) followed by HERC2 or NCOA4 immunoprecipitation ( IP ) . Immunoblot analysis of endogenous NCOA4 revealed an interaction with HERC2 under basal cell culture conditions where iron is replete and that this interaction was enhanced under excess iron conditions . Conversely , HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was severely attenuated following iron chelation ( Figure 3A ) . We also examined endogenous HERC2 binding to stably expressed NCOA4-FLAG-HA ( CTAP ) tagged protein under iron replete and deficient conditions . Immunoblot analysis of endogenous HERC2 revealed an interaction in iron replete and excess iron conditions , while HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was attenuated following iron chelation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 007Figure 3 .

NCOA4 stability was evaluated by immunoblot . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 008 To define the region of HERC2 that recognizes NCOA4 , we sub-cloned and expressed six fragments spanning the HERC2 open reading frame as depicted in Figure 3B ( Bekker-Jensen et al . , 2010 ) . Endogenous NCOA4 associated with Fragment 3 ( HERC2F3 , amino acids 1700\u20132800; Figure 3C , D ) , comprised of a homology region shared by HERC2 and Mindbomb E3 ligases and the CUL7 CPH domain ( conserved domain in CUL7 , PARC , and HERC2 proteins ) ( Itoh et al . , 2003; Kasper et al . , 2006; Kaustov et al . , 2007 ) . Further mapping of the HERC2 sequence between amino acids 1700\u20132800 revealed a strong interaction between endogenous NCOA4 and HERC2F3\u22126 , corresponding to the CUL7 homology domain and an unstructured region of HERC2 ( residues 2540\u20132700 , Figure 3E ) . Iron chelation also abrogated binding of NCOA4 to exogenously expressed HERC2 ( Figure 3F ) . The finding that HERC2 predominantly associates with NCOA4 when intracellular iron is high led us to examine whether HERC2 modulates NCOA4 stability , thereby reducing flux through the ferritinophagy pathway . Our previous work revealed a reduction in NCOA4 protein expression upon excess iron loading ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . Knockdown of HERC2 using two independent siRNAs resulted in accumulation of NCOA4 protein ( Figure 3G ) . Furthermore , siRNA-mediated HERC2 depletion promoted a significant increase in NCOA4 half-life ( Figure 3H , I ) . Further supporting a role for HERC2 in regulating NCOA4 stability in the presence of high intracellular iron , overexpression of HERC2F3\u22126 abrogated NCOA4 loss following excess iron loading likely through interfering with the binding of NCOA4 to endogenous HERC2 ( Figure 3J ) . Similarly , HERC2 knockdown stabilized NCOA4 following FAC treatment ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Notably , HERC2 depletion did not result in complete stabilization of NCOA4 turnover . Consistently , pre-treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib ( Btz ) only partly rescued NCOA4 turnover in response to cycloheximide ( CHX ) treatment ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Likewise , pre-treatment of cells with the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin ( Baf ) only partly rescued NCOA4 turnover in response to CHX treatment ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . We determined that in addition to HERC2-dependent turnover , NCOA4 also undergoes turnover via basal autophagy . Under iron deficient conditions , despite continued autophagic turnover , the apparent lack of HERC2 action on NCOA4 leads to a net increase in NCOA4 protein level thereby promoting ferritinophagy to release iron from ferritin for use by the cell . Using recombinant proteins , we subsequently mapped HERC2 binding to NCOA4383\u2212522 , the same region as is necessary for FTH1 binding ( Figure 4A ) . Efforts to map the interaction to a sub-domain of NCOA4383\u2212522 were unsuccessful and suggest that the binding requires a folded epitope on NCOA4 . Notably , mutation of residues I489 and W497 had no effect on binding to HERC2 ( Figure 1H ) suggesting a HERC2 binding site distinct from that for FTH1 . We further mapped the binding on HERC2 to the minimal CUL7 domain ( amino acids 2553\u20132639; Figure 4B ) . Similar to in vivo studies , this interaction was dependent on a chelatable iron ion as DFO attenuated binding in vitro ( Figure 4C ) . The dependence of the HERC2-NCOA4 interaction on iron levels suggests that either the complex or the individual components bind an iron molecule . While neither NCOA4 nor the HERC2 CUL7 domain have predicted iron binding sites ( Passerini et al . , 2011 ) , inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) analysis showed that iron co-purified with a recombinant fragment of NCOA4383\u2212509 , but not the HERC2 CUL7 domain or buffer alone ( Figure 4C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Thus , NCOA4 ( through residues 383\u2013509 ) can function as an iron-binding protein and its ability to interact with HERC2 in cells is anticipated to depend on the level of bioavailable iron . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 009Figure 4 .

We therefore examined the role of NCOA4 in a K562 erythroleukemia cell culture model of hemin-induced erythroid differentiation .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 011 We next confirmed ncoa4 is expressed at sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish as previously published ( Weber et al . , 2005 ) including in the intermediate cell mass ( ICM ) at 24 hpf ( hours post-fertilization ) , a structure that is equivalent to the mouse yolk sac E7 . 5\u201310 . 0 . At 48 and 72 hpf , ncoa4 is expressed in circulating erythrocytes visible in the yolk sac , heart , and liver ( L ) ( Figure 5E ) . Consistent with its expression in sites of hematopoiesis and circulating erythrocytes , morpholino knockdown of ncoa4 severely disrupts erythropoiesis as visualized at 30 hpf in globin-LCR:eGFP transgenic zebrafish , which express GFP in erythroid cells ( Ganis et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 5F ) . Morphants exhibit severe reduction in circulating GFP-labeled erythroid cells ( Figure 5G ) . Furthermore , hemoglobinization as visualized by o-dianisidine staining was severely reduced using two independent morpholinos to ncoa4 ( Figure 5H ) . Taken together these findings suggest that during erythroid differentiation , the majority of iron obtained via endocytosed holo-transferrin is stored in ferritin before mobilization via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy for heme synthesis . \n Our data reveal that HERC2 associates with NCOA4 in an iron-dependent manner , and for the first time , provide evidence that NCOA4 itself is an iron-sensing protein capable of coordinating iron via a C-terminal helical domain . While the sheer size of HERC2 precludes traditional in vitro studies , we demonstrate that HERC2 ablation or overexpression of HERC2F3\u22126 ( amino acids 2540\u20132700 containing the NCOA4 binding site ) stabilizes endogenous NCOA4 under iron-replete conditions . We noted that NCOA4 remains unstable , albeit with significantly slower kinetics , upon HERC2 depletion , and pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib rescues , but does not completely restore NCOA4 protein expression following CHX treatment . Likewise , blockade of autophagy only partially stabilizes NCOA4 . These data indicate that NCOA4 levels are under the control of dual autophagic and proteasomal systems , and both are operative in the setting of intermediate iron levels as observed under typical cell culture conditions . Turnover through autophagy could be linked specifically to its capture during the process of ferritinophagy , although we cannot rule out the possibility that NCOA4 also has additional cargo that may also contribute to its flux through the autophagy system . When iron is available , the iron bound pool of NCOA4 can be targeted for ubiquitylation by HERC2 , leading to NCOA4 turnover through the proteasome . When iron levels are low , such as modeled here by chelation , a pool of NCOA4 is liberated from the grasp of HERC2 and may then participate in trafficking of ferritin to the lysosome . Inappropriate depletion or accumulation of FTH1 may also provide insight into the dynamics of NCOA4 turnover . While FTH1 knockout leads to a marked decrease in NCOA4 levels ( Figure 2D ) , likely due to an increase in free iron thereby activating HERC2-mediated turnover , over-expression of wild type FTH1 leads to a marked accumulation of NCOA4 ( Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . This may be due to an over-abundance of ferritin complexes chelating free iron ( as suggested by a rise in IRP2 levels , Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) ; however , as re-expression of FTH1R23A in FTH1-null cells leads to only a modest increase in NCOA4 there is likely some ability of ferritin complexes to sequester NCOA4 from degradation via HERC2 and even autophagy . A model that depicts multiple modes of regulation of NCOA4 is provided in Figure 6 . The structural determinants of NCOA4 iron binding and how iron is loaded onto NCOA4 have yet to be determined but we do note the presence of multiple conserved cysteine residues throughout NCOA4 that may play a role in iron binding . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 012Figure 6 . Iron Levels Regulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy . A model of NCOA4 ferritinophagy regulation ( see the text for details ) . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 10308 . 012 The mechanism of NCOA4 regulation by HERC2 contrasts with the recently described role of HERC2 in degradation of the iron-sensing protein FBXL5 , as HERC2-mediated FBXL5 turnover was demonstrated to occur basally , independent of FBXL5 iron binding capacity ( Moroishi et al . , 2014 ) . Upon intracellular iron depletion , FBXL5 is rapidly destabilized via the activity of an unidentified E3 ubiquitin ligase , and loss of HERC2 function cannot restore FBXL5 expression under such conditions ( Moroishi et al . , 2014 ) . FBXL5 loss leads to stabilization of IRP2 , a ferritin translational repressor ( Salahudeen et al . , 2009; Vashisht et al . , 2009 ) . Together , NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and IRP2-mediated inhibition of ferritin translation function to mobilize intracellular iron stored within ferritin complexes and prevent further iron storage until intracellular iron levels are restored ( Figure 6 ) . Erythropoiesis is defined by a complex series of differentiation steps beginning with the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell leading to the mature enucleated discoid erythrocyte replete with hemoglobin . One of the defining aspects of erythroid differentiation is the requirement for massive amounts of iron to support the synthesis of increasing amounts of hemoglobin in the late stages of erythroblast maturation ( An et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , of the approximately 3\u20135 g of iron in the human body , greater than 2 g is present as heme in hemoglobin of erythrocytes ( Pantopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . While it is clear that iron is delivered to erythroblasts via circulating transferrin and that this iron is required for heme synthesis in the mitochondria , the intracellular itinerary of iron once liberated from transferrin is unclear in the developing erythroblast . Prior studies suggest either direct delivery of endosomal iron to the mitochondria vs an intermediate storage step in ferritin followed by lysosomal degradation of ferritin with subsequent iron release ( Vaisman et al . , 1997; Sheftel et al . , 2007 ) . Our findings suggest that in the developing zebrafish and during hemin-induced erythroid-like K562 differentiation , the majority of iron obtained via endocytosed holo-transferrin is stored in ferritin before release via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy . In support of this model is a recent transcriptome analysis showing a significant upregulation of NCOA4 mRNA into the top 25 highest expressed genes at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation , the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis ( An et al . , 2014 ) . While FTL mRNA remains within the top 25 mRNAs expressed throughout all terminal erythroid differentiation steps , FTH1 mRNA peaks at the final two stages ( polychromatic erythroblast and orthochromatic erythroblast ) . As NCOA4 specifically recognizes FTH1 and not FTL , this could suggest that during erythroid development there is a switch in the composition of ferritin complexes from predominantly FTL favoring storage of iron to a mix of FTH1-FTL . At later stages when iron is required for heme biosynthesis , NCOA4 could then more efficiently and with better kinetics target for degradation ferritin complexes with this higher FTH1-FTL ratio . The modulation of NCOA4 transcript levels during erythroid differentiation suggests an additional layer of regulation of NCOA4 at the transcriptional level that we do not yet understand beyond the post-translational roles of HERC2 and autophagy . The recent results from Dowdle et al . support the role of NCOA4 in maintaining iron homeostasis in vivo as ncoa4 knockout led to inappropriate accumulation of iron in mouse splenic macrophages ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) . The authors do not specifically note a defect in erythropoiesis in their mice; however , as splenic macrophages play an important role in turnover of senescent red blood cells and a role in maintaining erythropoiesis during pathological erythropoiesis states , this suggests some defect in erythropoiesis for which splenic macrophages may be compensating ( Ramos et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , the role of NCOA4 in erythropoiesis could be limited to the setting of embryonic development and stress erythropoiesis which our zebrafish and K562 model systems are best suited to evaluate . Further study of NCOA4 in vivo in specific tissue compartments , including the erythropoietic compartment , will be necessary in order to decipher the role of NCOA4 in not only erythropoiesis but also overall organismal iron metabolism . \n Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . 293T , U2OS , HCT116 , and K562 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , United States ) and tested for mycoplasma contamination .

{"lay_summary":"Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause serious food poisoning in humans . Infections with this bacterium can be particularly dangerous to young children , pregnant women , the elderly , and individuals with weakened immune systems because they are more susceptible to developing serious complications that can sometimes lead to death . The bacteria infect cells in the lining of the human gut . Cells that detect the bacteria respond by producing proteins called interferons and other signaling proteins that activate the body's immune system to fight the infection . One of the genes that the interferons activate encodes a protein called ISG15 , which helps to defend the body against viruses . However , it is not clear what role ISG15 plays in fighting bacterial infections . Here , Radoshevich et al . studied the role of ISG15 in human cells exposed to L . monocytogenes . The experiments show that ISG15 levels increase in the cells , but that the initial increase does not depend on Interferon proteins . Instead , ISG15 production is triggered by an alternative pathway called the cytosolic surveillance pathway , which is activated by the presence of bacterial DNA inside the cell . Further experiments found that ISG15 can counteract the infections of L . monocytogenes both in cells grown in cultures and in living mice . ISG15 modifies other proteins in the cell to promote the release of proteins called cytokines that help the body to eliminate the bacteria . Radoshevich et al . 's findings reveal a new role for ISG15 in fighting bacterial infections . A future challenge will be to understand the molecular details of how ISG15 triggers the release of cytokines .","article":"ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated , linear di-ubiquitin-like protein , with anti-viral activity . The role of ISG15 during bacterial infection remains elusive . We show that ISG15 expression in nonphagocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection . Surprisingly this induction can be type I interferon independent and depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway , which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING , TBK1 , IRF3 and IRF7 . Most importantly , we observed that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo . We made use of stable isotope labeling in tissue culture ( SILAC ) to identify ISGylated proteins that could be responsible for the protective effect . Strikingly , infection or overexpression of ISG15 leads to ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins , which correlates with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection . Together , our data reveal a previously uncharacterized ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection , reinforcing the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response . \n Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause enteric infections . In addition , in immunocompromised individuals it can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and in pregnant women the feto-placental barrier potentially leading to cases of meningitis and septicemia . To be fully virulent , Listeria must evade macrophage killing , enter and replicate in epithelial cells and spread from cell to cell . Towards these aims Listeria subverts a number of normal host cell functions in order to promote its own replication and dissemination through a plethora of well-characterized virulence factors ( Cossart and Lebreton , 2014 ) . Conversely , Listeria induces a rapid and sterilizing CD8+ T cell-mediated adaptive immune response that has been extensively characterized ( Lara-Tejero and Pamer , 2004; Pamer , 2004 ) . A more recent area of investigation has been the innate immune response to the pathogen ( Stavru et al . , 2011 ) . Since Listeria is able to survive and replicate in the cytosol , several groups have sought to elucidate how bacteria are sensed within macrophages and more recently within nonphagocytic cells . Once Listeria has escaped from the phagosome , its multidrug efflux pumps secrete small molecules leading to activation of an IRF3-dependent cytosolic surveillance pathway ( CSP ) , resulting in type I interferon activation ( Crimmins et al . , 2008 ) . One of these small molecules , cyclic-di-AMP , is sufficient to activate interferon \u03b2 production in macrophages ( Woodward et al . , 2010 ) . In nonphagocytic cells , type I interferon induction seems to emanate from sensing of triphosphorylated RNA molecules via a RIG-I and MAVS-dependent pathway ( Abdullah et al . , 2012; Hagmann et al . , 2013 ) . Type I interferon production subsequently leads to autocrine or paracrine activation of interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) . We have recently shown that Listeria also activates the type III interferon pathway ( Lebreton et al . , 2011; Bierne et al . , 2012 ) , a pathway which was discovered much later than type I interferon ( Kotenko et al . , 2003; Sheppard et al . , 2003 ) . The type III interferon receptor has a more limited tissue expression pattern than the receptor for type I interferon but activates a signaling pathway similar to that of the type I interferon receptor . Several laboratories including ours have recently contributed to the understanding of the type III interferon-dependent response to intracellular viral and bacterial infections . Strikingly , the type III response occurs via peroxisomal MAVS ( Dixit et al . , 2010; Odendall et al . , 2014 ) . The role of one particular ISG , ISG15 , during bacterial infection remains elusive . ISG15 is a linear di-ubiquitin-like molecule ( ubl ) that is conserved from zebrafish to human; however , it is much less well characterized than other ubls ( Bogunovic et al . , 2013 ) . It can conjugate to over 300 cellular proteins and can also function as a cytokine to induce interferon-\u03b3 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( D'Cunha et al . , 1996; Giannakopoulos et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2005 ) . Since Listeria , as other pathogenic bacteria , often targets post-translational modifications during infection ( Bonazzi et al . , 2008; Ribet and Cossart , 2010; Ribet et al . , 2010 ) , we were interested in investigating the interplay between the interferon-stimulated ubl ISG15 and Listeria . ISG15 plays an important role in the innate immune response to viruses . Isg15 expression becomes rapidly upregulated , and the protein is subsequently conjugated to cellular and\/or viral targets following type I interferon induction ( Zhang and Zhang , 2011 ) . Mice deficient in ISG15 are susceptible to infection with Influenza , Sindbis , and Herpes viruses ( D'Cunha et al . , 1996; Lenschow et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . Furthermore , many viruses encode proteins that specifically impair ISGylation ( Frias-Staheli et al . , 2007 ) . ISG15 seems to be unique among ubls , as it can both modify specific target proteins and non-specifically modify proteins cotranslationally ( Frias-Staheli et al . , 2007; Durfee et al . , 2010; Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . Since ISG15 is strongly induced by type I interferon , which is produced during bacterial infection , we aimed to decipher whether ISG15 is induced during Listeria infection and if so whether ISGylation acts as a means of host defense against invading bacteria . Here , we show that in nonphagocytic cells ISG15 is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection and that , surprisingly , early induction can be type I interferon independent . Listeria-mediated ISG15 induction depends on the CSP , which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING , TBK1 , IRF3 , and IRF7 . Most importantly , we demonstrate that ISG15 counteracts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo . We identified protein targets of ISGylation following overexpression of ISG15 using stable isotope labeling in tissue culture ( SILAC ) analysis and uncovered a prominent enrichment in integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus . This enrichment correlated with an increase in canonical secretion of cytokines known to control infection , highlighting a new mechanism of regulation of the host response to an intracytosolic pathogen . \n To test whether ISG15 and ISGylation are induced upon bacterial infection , we infected HeLa cells with Listeria . Upon L . monocytogenes infection , ISG15 was massively induced , whereas incubation with the related non-pathogenic bacterium , Listeria innocua , did not lead to an increase in ISG15 production ( Figure 1A ) . We subsequently monitored ISG15 expression in cells infected with Listeria over time . ISG15 protein levels increased relatively rapidly; the unconjugated protein was already present at 6 hr post infection and accumulated steadily throughout the infection ( Figure 1B ) . We next investigated whether ISG15 induction following Listeria infection also occurs in vivo . After 72 hr of systemic sub-lethal Listeria infection in mice , there was a robust induction of ISG15 and ISGylated conjugates in infected liver tissue , revealing that Listeria infection leads to ISG15 induction both in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 1C ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 003Figure 1 . ISG15 is induced by Listeria monocytogenes infection both in vitro and in vivo and ISG15 induction can be type I interferon independent . ( A ) HeLa cells were lysed and immunoblotted with \u03b1-ISG15 , \u03b1-EF-Tu ( EF-Tu is a prokaryotic translation elongation factor that we use as an indicator of infection level ) , and \u03b1-ACTIN following 12 or 24 hr of interferon \u03b2 treatment at 1000 units\/ml , infection with L . monocytogenes for 18 hr at multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 or 25 bacteria per human cell , and incubation with Listeria innocua at MOI of 10 or 25 bacteria per human cell .

( G ) 2fTGH and U5A ( IFNAR2\u2212\/\u2212 ) cells were lysed and immunoblotted with \u03b1-ISG15 and \u03b1-ACTIN following Listeria infection for 18 hr .

( B ) Percent invasion ( as calculated by % of inoculum ) of 2fTGH and U5A cell lines by L . monocytogenes strain EGD following 2 hr of infection . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 004 Since ISG15 protein levels increased relatively rapidly and ISG15 is known to be transcriptionally induced in response to interferon , we monitored transcript levels of both ISG15 and IFNB1 by quantitative real time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) . Interestingly , we found that the two transcripts are concomitantly induced after 3 hr of infection with Listeria ( Figure 1D , E ) . This concomitant induction led us to hypothesize that ISG15 could be induced in an interferon-independent manner during Listeria infection . In order to test this hypothesis , we used the viral protein B18R to block signaling from the interferon receptor ( Chairatvit et al . , 2012 ) . The protein acts similarly to a blocking antibody . When cells are pretreated with B18R , the viral protein inhibits binding of interferon to its receptor , which is thus prevented from signaling . Following pretreatment with B18R , HeLa cells were either stimulated with interferon or infected with Listeria to assess whether the bacterial-ISG15 induction was dependent on secreted interferon signaling in an autocrine or paracrine manner . We observed that bacteria-induced ISG15 production was not diminished by B18R pretreatment in stark contrast to the interferon-induced ISG15 signal , which was almost entirely abrogated by B18R pretreatment ( Figure 1F ) . To confirm the B18R results , we took advantage of a human fibrosarcoma cell line , 2fTGH , from which interferon-unresponsive mutants have been isolated ( Pellegrini et al . , 1989 ) . The U5A clone lacks a functional IFNAR2 receptor ( IFNAR2\u2212\/\u2212 ) and thus is impaired in type I interferon receptor signaling ( Lutfalla et al . , 1995 ) . 2fTGH and U5A cells were both highly permissive to Listeria infection ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Strikingly in the U5A cells ( defective for type I interferon binding and signaling ) , as in 2fTGH cells , there is still a robust ISG15 response to Listeria infection ( Figure 1G ) . Since B18R treatment does not inhibit type III interferon signaling , ISG15 induction could arise via type III interferon receptor activation ( Bandi et al . , 2010 ) . However , 2fTGH cells are unresponsive to type III interferon ( Zhou et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , the ISG15 protein induction that we observed is independent of both type I and type III interferon signaling . Taken together , our results show that ISG15 can be induced by Listeria in an interferon-independent manner in human nonphagocytic cells . We thus sought to determine how ISG15 was induced and what consequences ISG15 expression had on the cell and on infection . To determine which signaling pathway was responsible for the Listeria-induced ISG15 transcript and to help identify the cellular compartment in which bacteria are sensed , we made use of Listeria strains that are impaired at different stages of infection . Incubation of cells with L . innocua , a non-pathogenic Listeria species which cannot invade cells , did not induce ISG15 induction , demonstrating that external pathogen recognition receptors were not involved ( Figure 2A ) . We then used a strain of L . innocua that expresses Internalin B ( InlB ) , a L . monocytogenes virulence factor that mediates entry into nonphagocytic cells ( Dramsi et al . , 1995 ) . These bacteria enter the cell and are entrapped in a membrane-bound phagosome , but lack the required virulence factors to escape from it . This strain was also unable to induce an ISG15 signal , suggesting that the pathogen recognition receptors that survey the phagosome are not sufficient for ISG15 induction ( Figure 2A ) . Listeria's hemolysin , listeriolysin O ( LLO ) is an extremely potent virulence factor , which triggers vacuolar escape of the bacterium as well as a plethora of changes in the host cell ( Hamon et al . , 2012 ) . Strikingly , we found that the \u0394hly mutant was able to potently induce ISG15 ( Figure 2A ) . Thus , LLO is not necessary for ISG15 induction . However , in several human epithelial cell lines the mutant that lacks LLO ( \u0394hly ) can still escape into the cytosol ( Portnoy et al . , 1988; Marquis et al . , 1995 ) . Listeria expresses two phospholipases that can compensate for the lack of LLO in the \u0394hly mutant in order to free the bacterium from the phagosome in human epithelial cells ( Marquis et al . , 1995; Smith et al . , 1995 ) . To assess whether Listeria trapped in the phagosome could induce ISG15 , we constructed a triple mutant ( lacking LLO , PLCA , and PLCB ) of Listeria . This mutant is unable to escape the phagosome of human epithelial cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Single mutants ( either in PLCA or LLO ) , which escape into the cytosol , induce a strong ISG15 signal relative to non-infected cells ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , the triple mutant that is confined to the phagosome does not induce ISG15 ( Figure 2B ) . We thus conclude that only cytoplasmic bacteria induce ISG15 . In fact , the only other mutant to induce less ISG15 production was the \u0394actA mutant ( Figure 2A ) . This mutant is unable to spread from cell to cell and cannot escape autophagic recognition , degradation , and lysis ( Gouin et al . , 2005; Yoshikawa et al . , 2009 ) . As a result bacterial load is much lower compared to wild-type bacteria , providing an explanation for the reduced ISG15 signal ( Figure 2A ) . Taken together , our results reveal that ISG15 induction stems from cytosolic bacteria . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 005Figure 2 . Listeria induces ISG15 via the cytosolic surveillance pathway ( CSP ) which senses bacterial DNA . ( A ) Cells were lysed and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies following infection with various mutants of Listeria: Listeria strain EGD ( MOI 10 ) , \u0394hly ( MOI 10 ) , \u0394actA ( MOI of 50 ) , and L . innocua + InlB ( MOI of 100 ) . Different MOIs were used at the outset in an attempt to equalize Colony forming units ( CFUs ) at the end of the experiment .

( B ) As before cells were lysed and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies following infection with Listeria strain EGD-e PrfA* ( MOI 10 ) , \u0394plcA ( MOI 10 ) , \u0394hly ( MOI of 10 ) , and a triple mutant of \u0394hly\u0394plcA\u0394plcB ( MOI of 100 ) .

( A ) qRT-PCR indicating relative quantity of STING levels normalized to GAPDH levels in HeLa cells treated with siControl or siRNA against STING . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 007 In order to determine which pathway was essential for ISG15 induction , we performed an siRNA screen of innate immune molecules that are known to be involved in bacterial sensing ( Figure 2C ) . As for the experiments described above , we used HeLa cells for the siRNA screen . Although HeLa cells are reported to lack STING ( Burdette and Vance , 2013 ) , the ATCC line we worked with expressed STING mRNA , as evidenced by qRT-PCR . We were able to specifically extinguish this signal with siRNA ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Our data showed that the ISG15 signal was clearly dependent on IRF3 , IRF7 , STING , and TBK1 , implicating the CSP . In further support of an interferon-independent signal , depleting STAT1 , which is a critical mediator of type I and III interferon signaling did not abrogate the ISG15 signal ( Figure 2C ) . In non-immune cells interferon induction has been linked to sensing of triphosphorylated RNA by RIG-I ( Abdullah et al . , 2012; Hagmann et al . , 2013 ) ; however , in our experimental conditions , RIG-I did not seem to be required for the ISG15 signal . Instead , it seems that direct ISG15 induction occurs through a pathway similar to the CSP in macrophages . We next sought which PAMP was necessary and sufficient for ISG15 induction . We transfected cells with either Listeria genomic DNA , Listeria genomic DNA pre-treated with DNAse , Listeria total RNA , or we permeabilized cells in the presence of cyclic-di-AMP . To control whether the cyclic di-AMP was biologically active and reached the cytosol of the cells , we assessed IFNB1 levels by qRT-PCR ( Figure 2D ) . As expected Listeria cyclic di-AMP led to an increase in IFNB1 transcript levels . Although IFNB1 induction with cyclic di-AMP was lower than that reported for murine macrophages ( Woodward et al . , 2010 ) , it was similar to that reported for human phagocytes and monocytes ( Hansen et al . , 2014 ) . Listeria genomic DNA was the only PAMP sufficient for an increase in ISG15 levels ( Figure 2E ) , whereas ISG15 levels following cytosolic exposure to cyclic-di-AMP did not increase ( Figure 2D ) . Collectively , these data implicate that the CSP can directly induce ISG15 after sensing of bacterial DNA in the cytosol of cells in a pathway that requires STING , TBK1 , IRF3 , and IRF7 . We next assessed whether ISG15 has a functional effect on infection . We created a retroviral construct that expresses an epitope-tagged version of ISG15 ( 3XFlag-6His-ISG15 ) . We then infected cells that stably express 3XFlag-6His-ISG15 with Listeria . As a control , cells were retrovirally transduced with pBabe puro empty vector . For the same multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) after 3 hr of infection , stable overexpression of ISG15 resulted in 50% fewer cytosolic bacteria as compared to control cells ( Figure 3A ) . We then assessed bacterial uptake by differentiating between the bacteria that are inside the cell or those that remain on the surface ( inside-out staining ) and did not observe a difference between control and ISG15-overexpressing cells for invasion ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . During a time course of infection in these cells at 7 and 12 hr , there were still 50% fewer bacteria , and by 24 hr , the levels of bacteria had equalized between the two cell lines ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . This time course suggests that ISG15 does not impact bacterial replication as an active bacterial clearance mechanism would ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . We then knocked down ISG15 during infection . This increased bacterial load by nearly twofold after 15 hr ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These data strongly suggest that ISG15 plays a role in protection against Listeria infection following uptake . To further explore this phenotype in primary cells , we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from wild-type and Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 embryos . We infected these cells with Listeria and we observed a fivefold increase in bacterial load in Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs compared to wild-type MEFs for the same MOI ( Figure 3C , D ) . Interestingly , Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs are not susceptible to other intracellular pathogens such as Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium , and in HeLa cells only Staphylococcus aureus is able to induce as much ISG15 as Listeria ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . Indeed , S . flexneri and S . typhimurium induce very little ISG15 . We next examined whether ISG15 could also play a role during Listeria infection in vivo by assessing the susceptibility of Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 animals to the pathogen during systemic infection ( Osiak et al . , 2005 ) . ISG15-deficient mice exhibited a significant increase in bacterial load compared to wild-type animals in both the spleen and liver after 72 hr of systemic sub-lethal Listeria infection ( Figure 3E , F ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that ISG15 restricts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 008Figure 3 .

( A ) Cells were treated with siControl or siISG15 for 24 hr and subsequently infected for the indicated times with Listeria ( MOI 25 ) , lysed and immunoblotted with \u03b1-ISG15 and \u03b1-ACTIN antibodies . Extremely efficient knockdown was achieved . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 010 Since ISG15 can mediate its protective effect through conjugation-dependent or conjugation-independent mechanisms , we wanted to determine if conjugation contributed to ISG15's role in defense against Listeria . Therefore , we initially assessed whether Listeria could induce the enzymes required for ISGylation . To this end , we performed RNASeq of Lovo cells infected with Listeria for 24 hr compared to uninfected cells . The RNASeq data has been uploaded to Array Express with the accession E-MTAB-3649 ( Radoshevich et al . , 2015b ) . We found that UBE1L ( E1 ) , UBE2L6 ( E2 ) , HERC5 and TRIM25 ( E3s ) mRNA are all significantly upregulated following Listeria infection , as is the deconjugating enzyme USP18 ( Figure 3G ) . In order to assess whether UBE2L6 and TRIM25 are induced as rapidly as ISG15 at the protein level , we monitored their expression by immunoblot at 3 hr post infection ( Figure 3H ) . Interestingly , TRIM25 already displayed increased expression relative to loading control at 3 hr post infection . UBE2L6 was present in these cells at this time point as well . We then sought to determine whether conjugation-incompetent MEFs would have a higher bacterial load following Listeria infection . Primary MEFs that lack UBE1L , and thus can not form ISG15 conjugates , have a much higher bacterial burden following Listeria infection than wild-type MEFs at 4 hr post infection . This phenotype mirrors the bacterial burden of Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs , clearly indicating that ISG15's role in host defense against Listeria in vitro requires ISGylation ( Figure 3I ) . Since ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is known to be covalently linked to hundreds of cellular and several viral substrates ( Giannakopoulos et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2005 ) , our goal was to identify which substrates following overexpression of ISG15 could account for the protective effect detected in the context of Listeria infection and used a proteomic approach . We made use of SILAC coupled with LC-MS\/MS and compared cells that express empty vector , cells that express ISG15 and cells that express ISG15 that were treated with interferon , the primary inducer of ISGylation ( Figure 4A , B ) . We identified thirty ISGylated proteins modified following overexpression of ISG15 ( Figure 4C\u2013E , Figure 4\u2014source data 1 , depicted in blue ) . The proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( Vizcaino et al . , 2014 ) via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD001805 ( Radoshevich et al . , 2015a ) . Interestingly , these proteins have not yet been reported to be targets of ISGylation . Following interferon treatment , ISG15 modified twelve additional proteins distinct from those that were ISGylated after overexpression without treatment ( Figure 4C\u2013E , Figure 4\u2014source data 1 , depicted in red ) . Three of these proteins are known targets of ISGylation following interferon treatment in the aforementioned screens . The other nine are novel substrates of ISGylation . To gain more insight into the role of ISGylation of the modified substrates following overexpression , we performed a gene ontology ( GO ) analysis of the thirty ISGylated proteins . To our surprise over 80% of ISG15-target proteins are integral membrane proteins ( Figure 5A ) . Even more intriguingly they are known to be primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and\/or are critical for glycosylation , ER morphology and ER to Golgi trafficking ( e . g . , the oligosaccharyl-transferase ( OST ) complex , RTN4 , ATL3 , SEC22B , ERGIC1 , and ERGIC3; Figure 4C ) . One of the proteins enriched following ISG15 overexpression is Magnesium Transporter 1 ( MAGT1 ) . MAGT1 is critical for T cell activation and patients with a deletion in the MAGT1 gene are susceptible to viral and certain bacterial infections ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . The protein is localized to the cell surface or to the ER where it interacts with the OST complex , which is critical for N-glycosylation ( Pfeffer et al . , 2014 ) . Notably , we also identified multiple proteins from the OST complex as targets of ISGylation ( Figure 4C , inset ) . To validate that MAGT1 was modified by ISG15 , we affinity purified ISGylated proteins and performed immunoblot analysis ( Figure 5B ) . Two higher molecular weight ISG15-MAGT1 complexes appear that are absent in control cells ( Figure 5B , arrows ) . To assess whether MAGT1 was ISGylated following infection , we immunoprecipitated ISG15 and could show that there is a higher molecular weight MAGT1 complex that immunoprecipitates with ISG15 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Additionally , non-conjugated MAGT1 was enriched following ISG15 immunoprecipitation as well . Whether the interaction is direct or indirect within a multi-protein complex remains to be determined . Of note , MAGT1 is also induced by Listeria infection ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . A second target of ISGylation following ISG15 overexpression is Reticulon 4 ( RTN4 ) ( Figure 4C , D ) . It is known that RTN4 helps to determine the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum ( Voeltz et al . , 2006 ) . We also validated that endogenous RTN4 was modified by ISG15 by immunoblot ( Figure 5B ) , and we detected an upshifted ladder of modified RTN4 that was also recognized by the ISG15 antibody . ISG15 is not known to make chains so the ladder most likely corresponds to either multiple ISGylations of RTN4 or concomitant modifications of RTN4 by ISG15 together with other modifiers as opposed to a single modification . Here again we could validate the endogenous modification of RTN4 by ISG15 following Listeria infection ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) by detecting multiple distinct slower migrating bands of RTN4 and ISG15 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Interestingly , Atlastin-3 , another protein that affects ER morphology was also identified as an ISG15 target . We attempted to validate this interaction by immunoblot but were unable to identify an upshifted complex , in part due to inadequate antibody sensitivity ( data not shown ) . Atlastin-3 is an ER dynamin-like GTPase that can alter the morphology of both the ER and the Golgi apparatus ( Rismanchi et al . , 2008; Hu et al . , 2009 ) . RTN4 and Atlastin-3 can interact to help shape the tubular ER . When RTN4 is overexpressed it increases protein disulphide-isomerase ( PDI ) clustering in the cell ( Yang et al . , 2009; Bernardoni et al . , 2013 ) . We thus assessed PDI puncta formation following ISG15 overexpression and in line with our hypothesis found a dramatic increase in puncta formed upon ISG15 expression ( Figure 5C ) . We further assessed the ER morphology of ISG15-overexpressing cells by visualizing SEC61-GFP or KDEL-BFP . Neither of these markers displayed an apparent redistribution in ISG15 overexpressing cells relative to control cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . We also assayed whether there was a difference in ER mass using ER-tracker and FACS analysis ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . There was no detectable difference between the two cell lines in ER mean fluorescence intensity . Taken together , the most striking effect of ISG15 overexpression on ER morphology is PDI clustering and distribution . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 011Figure 4 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06848 . 016 Certain UBL proteins , such as SUMO and ISG15 , modify 1\u20135% of a given substrate; nevertheless , this partial modification is sufficient to lead to a phenotypic effect on the substrate . We thus investigated whether the enrichment of ER and Golgi proteins modified by ISG15 could have an effect on the primary function of these organelles . Canonical secretion of cytokines and growth factors involves translation and import of the proteins into the ER , folding and modification ( e . g . , glycosylation ) , within the ER , followed by sorting and trafficking within the Golgi culminating in targeting to the plasma membrane . Since we found proteins implicated in many of these processes to be ISGylated ( Figure 4C ) , we thus hypothesized that canonical secretion could be altered in the ISG15-overexpressing cells . As TNF-\u03b1 is known to lead to canonical secretion of many cytokines , via activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways , we assessed secreted cytokine levels in ISG15-overexpressing cells compared to control cells following TNF-\u03b1 treatment . Among a panel of 31 human cytokines , we detected increased secretion of IL-8 and IL-6 in ISG15-expressing cells relative to control cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We validated these findings with quantitative ELISAs for IL-6 and IL-8 ( Figure 5D ) . ISG15-expressing cells secreted significantly more IL-6 and IL-8 following TNF-\u03b1 treatment than control cells ( Figure 5D ) . As ISG15 itself has been reported to be able to act as a secreted cytokine , we also assessed ISG15 in the supernatant . However , we did not observe secreted ISG15 from either cell type ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Finally , based on the results observed following TNF-\u03b1 treatment , it was of critical importance to test whether a similar ISG15-dependent modulation of cytokine secretion occurred during Listeria infection . As shown in Figure 5E , following infection , ISG15-overexpressing cells secreted significantly more IL-8 than infected wild-type cells at both 3 and 7 hr post infection . The difference in IL-8 concentration in the media after 24 hr of infection was nearly threefold higher in ISG15-overexpressing cells relative to control cells ( Figure 5F ) . As with IL-8 the IL-6 concentration in the media increased by threefold relative to control cells following 24 hr of infection . Moreover , we could not detect ISG15 in the supernatant following infection in either cell line ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . In order to confirm this effect on cytokine secretion under endogenous conditions , we assayed whether ISG15 could modulate cytokine secretion following infection with L . monocytogenes as opposed to L . innocua expressing InlB . Infection with L . monocytogenes led to significantly higher IL-8 and IL-6 than L . innocua expressing InlB , which correlates with increased ISG15 expression ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Furthermore , we assessed cytokine secretion in transformed MEFs that lack ISG15 , relative to their wild type counterparts following Listeria infection . Despite significantly higher levels of bacteria in the Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs , the cells secreted significantly less IL-6 than wild-type cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Therefore , ISG15 appears to be a critical modulator of cytokine secretion following Listeria infection . Collectively , our data reveal that during Listeria infection ISG15 modification of distinct ER and Golgi proteins increases secretion of cytokines which are known to counteract infection in vivo . \n Listeria has long been used as a model organism to understand the adaptive immune response , however more recently interest in the field has focused on the innate immune pathways required to produce type I and type III interferons and bacterial modulators of type I and type III interferons during Listeria infection of nonphagocytic cells ( Lebreton et al . , 2011; Abdullah et al . , 2012; Bierne et al . , 2012; Hagmann et al . , 2013; Odendall et al . , 2014 ) . In phagocytic cells , the primary type I interferon response to Listeria is mediated by Listeria cyclic-di-AMP ( Woodward et al . , 2010 ) . In nonphagocytic cells , type I interferon is produced downstream of RIG-I sensing of triphosphorylated RNA molecules ( Abdullah et al . , 2012; Hagmann et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we highlight a complementary pathway , which can lead to rapid and direct interferon-independent induction of ISG15 , and potentially other ISGs , emanating from sensing of bacterial DNA . Notably , we implicate the same molecular players required for the CSP in macrophages . However cyclic-di-AMP , the PAMP sensed by the CSP in mouse macrophages , was not sufficient to directly induce ISG15 in an interferon-independent manner in nonphagocytic cells . Interestingly , a similar pathway was implicated in sensing the cytosolic bacterial DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages ( Manzanillo et al . , 2012 ) and sensing viral DNA in nonphagocytic cells ( Hasan et al . , 2013 ) . Our study complements and supports these findings as it also alludes to the importance of this response in nonphagocytic cells during Listeria infection . It is still an open question whether specific ISGs can contribute to a functional antibacterial state similar to an antiviral state . We hypothesized that the massive induction of ISG15 following Listeria infection must have a phenotypic effect on host cells . Indeed , we have demonstrated that ISG15 counteracts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo . The in vitro susceptibility is clearly conjugation-dependent and we have preliminary data suggesting that the conjugation incompetent mutant of ISG15 does not protect cells from infection ( data not shown ) . During viral infections ISG15 can restrict infection by direct modification of viral proteins ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) , by modification of host proteins that are important to viral replication ( Pincetic et al . , 2010 ) , by non-specific modification of newly translated proteins to target viral capsid ( Durfee et al . , 2010 ) and finally in the context of infection in vivo it can have non-conjugation dependent roles either within the cell or as a cytokine when secreted from polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( D'Cunha et al . , 1996; Werneke et al . , 2011; Bogunovic et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we highlight a novel mode of action of ISG15 on canonical cytokine secretion that correlates with modification of ER and Golgi proteins . Interestingly , ubiquitin itself can have an effect on secretion by playing a role in determining COPII vesicle size and cargo through specific Cullin E3 ligases ( Lu and Pfeffer , 2014 ) . To our knowledge , a link between the intracellular function of ISG15 and canonical secretion of other cytokines has not been reported , thus our work identifies a novel function of ISG15 , which could also play a role in other bacterial and viral infections . Two recent studies have underscored the importance of ISG15 in the human innate immune response to pathogens by characterizing patients who lack a functional ISG15 protein ( Bogunovic et al . , 2012; Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . ISG15-deficient patients were susceptible to Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin ( BCG ) . These individuals were shown to have reduced production of interferon \u03b3 , which was linked to ISG15's extracellular role as a cytokine . In light of our results , ISG15's intracellular role as a modulator of cytokine secretion in nonphagocytic cells could also be responsible for reduced production of interferon \u03b3 . Increased cytokine secretion mediated by ISG15 is a previously uncharacterized way for the host to engage the immune system to combat both bacterial and viral infection; the first cells that encounter Listeria , ( i . e . , nonphagocytic cells ) which are able to induce ISG15 at early time points could raise the alarm against an invading pathogen and as a result help alert innate immune cells to the site of infection . In particular , IL-6 and IL-8 are key mediators of neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in vivo and IL-6 has been repeatedly characterized as a critical mediator of the innate immune response to Listeria ( Baggiolini and Clark-Lewis , 1992; Dalrymple et al . , 1995; Personnic et al . , 2010 ) . If cytokine secretion in the absence of ISG15 is less efficient , it could help to explain the moderate but statistically significant susceptibility of Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 mice to systemic Listeria infection . These data coupled with the aforementioned human ISG15-deficient patient susceptibility to BCG infection highlight the in vivo relevance of ISG15 as an antibacterial factor ( Bogunovic et al . , 2012 ) . Finally , the interferon-independent induction of ISG15 and potentially other ISGs may help to explain the still perplexing phenotype of interferon receptor-deficient mice ( Ifnar\u2212\/\u2212 ) . IFNAR-deficient mice are highly resistant to Listeria infection when infected intravenously ( Auerbuch et al . , 2004; Carrero et al . , 2004; O'Connell et al . , 2004; Stockinger et al . , 2004 ) . If certain subsets of cells are in fact able to induce ISGs in the absence of interferon and if these ISGs like ISG15 could contribute to an antibacterial state , this may explain why these mice are resistant to Listeria infection . \n Dr Sandra Pellegrini ( Institut Pasteur ) kindly provided the 2fTGH and U5A ( IFNAR2\u2212\/\u2212 ) cell lines along with an \u03b1-ISG15 antibody ( gift from A Haas ) .

We used recombinant B18R ( 34-8185-81 ) and ELISA kits for human IL-8 ( 88-8086-88 ) , human IL-6 ( 88-7066-88 ) and mouse IL-6 ( 88-7064-88 ) from eBiosciences , San Diego , California . We used a human Pro-ISG15 ELISA kit from EMD Millipore ( CBA107 ) and a human cytokine array from Signosis , Sunnyvale , California ( EA-4002 ) . Bacterial strains used in this study are shown in Table 1 . Mutant strains of Listeria generated for this study were deleted from start to stop codon leaving intergenic regions intact ( BUG3646 , BUG3647 , and BUG3648 ) . The triple mutant ( LLO , PLCA , PLCB ) was constructed sequentially starting from a single mutant ( as opposed to a deletion of the entire operon ) . Genes were deleted in Listeria strain EGD-e prfA* ( BUG 3057 ) by double recombination as previously described ( Arnaud et al . , 2004 ) . Listeria strains and S . aureus were grown in brain\u2013heart infusion media ( BD ) . S . typhimurium was grown in Luria broth and S . flexneri in Tryptic Soy broth ( BD ) . Prior to infection overnight cultures of bacterial strains were diluted in new media and grown to exponential phase ( OD 0 . 8 to 1 ) , washed three times in serum-free mammalian cell culture media and resuspended in mammalian cell culture media at the indicated MOI . A fixed volume was then added to each well . Cells were centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rpm to synchronize infection . The cells were then incubated with the bacteria for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C , 10% CO2 . Following this incubation , the cells were washed with room temperature 1\u00d7 PBS and cell growth medium with 10% serum was added with 20 \u03bcg\/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria .

When indicated primary MEFs were transformed with a plasmid expressing SV40 Large T antigen ( BUG 3790 ) . Prior to infection , cells were seeded to attain 80% confluence on the day of infection . Female C57BL\/6 mice ( Isg15+\/+ or Isg15\u2212\/\u2212 ) were infected intravenously between 8 and 12 weeks of age with 5 \u00d7 105 bacteria per animal and sacrificed 72 hr following infection . Colony forming units per organ ( liver or spleen ) were enumerated after tissue dissociation and serial dilutions in sterile saline . For the SDS-PAGE of animal samples , wild-type mice were infected intravenously with Listeria or injected with sterile saline solution and sacrificed after 72 hr . The liver and spleen were isolated and dissociated . Tissue homogenates were then centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . For liver tissue , an aliquot of the soluble fraction below the layer of fat was removed and resuspended in 2\u00d7 Laemmli buffer . For the spleen an aliquot of the supernatant was resuspended in 2\u00d7 Laemmli buffer . The samples were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel and blotted for ISG15 levels . This study was carried out in strict accordance with the French national and European laws and conformed to the Council Directive on the approximation of laws , regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes ( 86\/609\/Eec ) . Experiments that relied on laboratory animals were performed in strict accordance with the Institut Pasteur's regulations for animal care and use protocol , which was approved by the Animal experiment Committee of the Institut Pasteur ( approval number n\u00b003\u201349 ) . For SILAC labeling , DMEM without L-Lysine , L-Arginine , and L-Glutamine ( Silantes , Germany ) was supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum ( Invitrogen , Waltham , Massachusetts ) , 2 mM Glutamax ( Invitrogen ) and naturally occurring L-Lysine HCl and L-Arginine HCl ( K0R0 , Light condition , Sigma ) , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5-D4-L-Lysine HCl and 13C6-L-Arginine HCl ( K4 , R6 , Medium condition , Silantes ) or 13C6 , 15N2-L-Lysine HCl and 13C6 , 15N4-L-Arginine HCl ( K8 , R10 , Heavy condition , Silantes ) . Lysine was added at its normal concentration in DMEM ( 146 mg\/l ) ; however , arginine was added at 30% of its normal concentration ( 25 mg\/l ) to prevent metabolic arginine to proline conversion . Stably transduced cell lines were labeled for a minimum of seven passages in their respective medium prior to treatment . Control cells ( pBabe plasmid empty vector ) were labeled light while Flag-His ISG15 ectopic expression cells ( pBabe-Flag-His ISG15 mature ) were labeled medium or heavy . The nickel affinity purification was performed as described previously ( Tatham et al . , 2009 ) , but adapted for mass-spectrometry ( Impens et al . , 2014 ) . We expanded the SILAC labeled cells to two large 500 cm2 per condition ( approximately 10 \u00d7 107 cells per condition ) . We then treated the heavy-labeled ISG15-expressing cells with type I interferon ( interferon \u03b12 ) at 1000 units per ml for 40 hr while the medium and light-labeled cells were not treated . At 40 hr , post-treatment cells were lysed in 8 ml lysis buffer per 500-cm2 dish ( 6 M Guanidium-HCl , 10 mM Tris , 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8 . 0 ) . The lysates from two dishes were combined for each condition , sonicated and centrifuged . The pellet was discarded and the protein concentration in the lysate was measured using a Bradford assay ( Biorad , Hercules , California ) . Equal protein amounts of each condition were mixed and proteins were reduced and alkylated by incubation with 5 mM tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) and 10 mM chloroacetamide for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark . Excess chloroacetamide was quenched with 20 mM dithriothreitol prior to incubation of the lysates overnight on a rotating wheel at 4\u00b0C with 1 ml of packed NiNTA agarose beads that were pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer ( Qiagen , Netherlands ) . The following day , the agarose beads were washed once in lysis buffer supplemented with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol . They were then washed once in pH 8 . 0 wash buffer ( 8 M Urea , 10 mM Tris , 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol ) , three times in pH 6 . 3 wash buffer ( 8 M Urea , 10 mM Tris , 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6 . 3 , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol ) , and eluted in 1 . 5 ml 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6 . 8 , 200 mM imidazole for 20 min at room temperature . The eluate contained approximately 500 \u03bcg of protein and was further analyzed by LC-MS\/MS . The eluate from the His-affinity purification was further diluted with 8 . 5 ml 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and proteins were digested with 20 \u03bcg trypsin overnight at 37\u00b0C ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin ) . Peptides were then purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge ( Waters , Milford , Massachusetts ) , and 2 \u03bcg was injected for LC-MS\/MS analysis on an Easy-nLC 1000 UHPLC system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , Massachusetts ) in line connected to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer with a NanoFlex source ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The sample was loaded on a reverse-phase column ( made in-house , 75 \u00b5m I . D . \u00d7 300 mm , 1 . 9 \u00b5m beads C18 Reprosil-Pur , Dr Maisch GmbH , Germany ) placed in a column oven ( Sonation GmbH , Biberach , Germany ) maintaining a constant temperature of 55\u00b0C . Peptides were eluted by a linear increase from 5 to 28% acetonitrile in 0 . 1% formic acid over 130 min followed by a 55 min linear increase to 45% acetonitrile in 0 . 1% formic acid at a constant flow rate of 250 nl\/min . The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode , automatically switching between MS and MS\/MS acquisition for the 15 most abundant ion peaks per MS spectrum . Full-scan MS spectra ( 300\u20131800 m\/z ) were acquired at a resolution of 70 , 000 after accumulation to a target value of 1 , 000 , 000 with a maximum fill time of 120 ms . The 15 most intense ions above a threshold value of 100 , 000 were isolated ( window of 2 . 5 Th ) for fragmentation by CID at a normalized collision energy of 25% after filling the trap at a target value of 500 , 000 for maximum 120 ms with an underfill ratio of 2 . 5% . The S-lens RF level was set at 55 , and we excluded precursor ions with single , unassigned , and charge states above eight from fragmentation selection . Data analysis was performed with MaxQuant ( version 1 . 4 . 1 . 2 ) ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) using the Andromeda search engine ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) with default search settings including a false discovery rate set at 1% on both the peptide and protein level . Spectra were searched against the human proteins in the Uniprot\/Swiss-Prot database ( database release version of January 2014 containing 20 , 272 human protein sequences , www . uniprot . org ) with a mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions of 4 . 5 and 20 ppm , respectively , during the main search . To enable the identification of SILAC-labeled peptides , the multiplicity was set to three with Lys4 and Arg6 settings in the medium channel and Lys8 and Arg10 in the heavy channel , allowing for a maximum of 3 labeled amino acids per peptide . Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and lysine , also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of three missed cleavages . Variable modifications were set to GlyGly modification of lysine residues , oxidation of methionine residues , and pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine residues . Carbamidomethyl formation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification . In total , 692 proteins were quantified , and for each protein , the log2 values of the normalized heavy\/medium and normalized medium\/light ratios were plotted against each other to generate the scatter plot depicted in Figure 4 , proteins listed in Figure 4E and Figure 4\u2014source data 1 . Proteins with log2 medium\/light ratios >1 were considered to be upregulated upon ISG15 expression , while proteins with log2 heavy\/medium ratios >1 were classified to be upregulated after interferon treatment . The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( Vizcaino et al . , 2014 ) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD001805 . GO terms enrichment analyses were performed using Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) bioinformatics resources ( Huang da et al . , 2009 ) . Total RNA was isolated using an RNAeasy kit ( Qiagen ) . 1 \u03bcg of RNA from each condition was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Biorad ) , and qRT-PCR was performed using SsoFast EvaGreen supermix ( Biorad ) on a CFX384 Real-Time System with a C1000 Touch Cycler ( Biorad ) . Data were then analyzed using the \u0394\u0394CT method relative to GAPDH levels for each sample . For RNASeq uninfected LoVo cells were compared to LoVo cells infected with L . monocytogenes strain EGD-e for 24 hr . The experiment was performed in triplicate , and total RNA following infection was isolated using an RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) . Samples were subsequently checked for quality and sent to Fasteris for library preparation and analysis . The RNASeq data has been uploaded to Array Express with the accession E-MTAB-3649 ( Radoshevich et al . , 2015b; https:\/\/www . ebi . ac . uk\/arrayexpress\/experiments\/E-MTAB-3649\/ ) entitled \u2018ISG15 counteracts Listeria monocytogenes infection\u2019 . For SDS-PAGE analysis , samples were lysed following one wash in 1\u00d7 PBS with 2\u00d7 Laemmli buffer . The cells were scraped in the sample buffer , resuspended and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min . Prior to running the samples on a gel , they were sonicated two times for 8 s each to disrupt DNA . For SDS-PAGE following a nickel-affinity purification , proteins were eluted with the following buffer ( 200 mM imidazole , 5% SDS , 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 6 . 7 , 30% glycerol , 720 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 0025% bromophenol blue ) . Gels were transferred using an iBLOT transfer system ( Invitrogen ) , blocked in 5% milk for 1 hr at RT , incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C , washed with 0 . 1% Tween in 1\u00d7 PBS three times ( each wash for 7 min ) , and incubated for an hour at room temperature with secondary antibody coupled to HRP . Blots were washed again three times with 0 . 1% Tween in 1\u00d7 PBS and revealed using ECL-2 ( Pierce , Waltham , Massachusetts ) . Sandra Pellegrini provided us with a plasmid containing a 3XFlag-6His-tagged mature human ISG15 in pCDNA3 , which was a kind gift of Jon Huibregtse . This plasmid was used to clone a 3XFlag-6His-ISG15 into pBabe-Puro ( kindly provided by Jayanta Debnath ) using BamHI and SalI ( BUG3354 ) . Retroviral particles were then generated by co-transfection of viral GagPol MoMLV ( BUG2666 ) and VSV-G ( BUG2667 , both plasmids generously provided by Thierry Heidmann ) and pBabe-puro 3xFlag-6His-ISG15 in 293T cells . Cells were transfected using Fugene HD according to manufacturer's instructions ( Promega ) . Supernatants were collected and applied to HeLa cells in the presence of polybrene ( Millipore ) as described ( in the protocol \u2018Production of retroviruses using Fugene 6\u2019 from the Weinberg lab on Addgene ) . Cells were then selected using 2 \u03bcg\/ml puromycin for 3 days . The population of cells that survived puromycin treatment was expanded and tested for ISG15 expression . For maintenance , cells were grown without puromycin and checked periodically for ISG15 expression . In order to deliver Cyclic diAMP to the cytosol , cells were permeabilized with saponin according to the protocol described in Johnson et al . ( 1996 ) with the indicated concentrations of Cyclic diAMP ( Biolog , Germany ) . For siRNA treatment of cells , reverse transfection was used to minimize the siRNA concentration required for knockdown . siGenome Smartpools ( Dharmacon , Lafayette , Colorado ) were resuspended and aliquoted as per manufacturer's instructions at a 20 \u03bcM concentration . Prior to transfection , stocks were further diluted 1:2 with RNAase-free water , and 1 . 5 \u03bcl siRNA pool was added to 25 \u03bcl serum-free media per well for a 24-well format . The final concentration per well was 60 nM . Equal volumes of Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Invitrogen , 1 . 5 \u03bcl ) were added to a second tube of 25 \u03bcl serum-free media , and master mixes were made where possible to minimize pipetting error . After mixing the smart pool tube with the RNAiMax tube and incubating for 15 min , 53 \u03bcl of mix was added to each well . Subsequently , 450 \u03bcl of cell suspension was added to each well at a concentration of 222 , 000 cells\/ml ( 100 , 000 cells per well ) . For larger scale knock down , the same concentrations were used but smart pools , RNAiMax , and cell concentrations were scaled up accordingly . Since ISG15 is induced by infection , we delivered siRNA during cell seeding and infected 24 hr later to make sure that the RNAi complexes were still present in the cells while ISG15 was induced . For the siRNA screen , cells were treated with siRNA pools for 72 hr and then infected with Listeria using the siControl condition as a positive control for ISG15 induction and uninfected\/untransfected cells as the baseline for normal levels of ISG15 ( since we show that nucleic acids alone can lead to ISG15 induction ) . Blots were quantified using ImageJ relative to actin as a loading control . Cells were plated on coverslips the day prior to an experiment . Cells were fixed in 4% PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , Pennsylvania ) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0 . 5% Triton X-100 ( Sigma ) . Coverslips processed for immunofluorescence were mounted on microscopy glass slides using Fluoromount G ( Interchim , France ) , and images were acquired using an inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope ( AxioVert 200M , Carl Zeiss Microscopy , Germany ) equipped with an EMCCD Neo camera ( Andor , Ireland ) and the software MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , California ) . FACS samples were labeled with 100 nM ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX ( Life Technologies ) for 30 min , trypsinized , washed , and analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["cell biology","microbiology and infectious disease"],"id":"elife-06848-v1"}
{"lay_summary":"Fruit flies are attracted to the smell of rotting fruit , and use it to guide them to nearby food sources . However , this task is made more challenging by the fact that the distribution of scent or odor molecules in the air is constantly changing . Fruit flies therefore need to cope with , and exploit , this variation if they are to use odors as cues . Odor molecules bind to receptors on the surface of nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons , and trigger nerve impulses that travel along these cells . The olfactory sensory neurons are connected to other cells called projection neurons that in turn relay information to the higher centers of the brain . While many studies have investigated how fruit flies can distinguish between different odors , less is known about how animals can use variation in the strength of an odor to guide them towards its source . Kim et al . have now addressed this question by devising a method for delivering precise quantities of odors in controlled patterns to fruit flies , and then measuring the responses of olfactory sensory neurons and projection neurons . These experiments revealed that olfactory sensory neurons\u2014which are found mainly in the flies' antennae\u2014responded most strongly whenever an odor changed rapidly in strength , and showed relatively little response to constant odors . An independent study by Schulze , Gomez-Marin et al . found that olfactory sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae also respond in a similar way . Kim et al . also found that the response of the projection neurons depended on both the rate of nerve impulses in the olfactory sensory neurons and on how quickly this rate was changing . But , unlike the olfactory sensory neurons , projection neurons showed their strongest responses immediately after an odor first appeared . Thus , in contrast to organisms such as bacteria and worms , which are highly sensitive to the local concentration gradients of odors , fruit flies instead appear to be more responsive to the sudden appearance of an odor in their environment . Kim et al . suggest that this difference may reflect the fact that for ground-based organisms , local gradients are generally reliable predictors of the location of an odor source . However , for flying insects , continually changing air currents mean that predictable local gradients are less common . Therefore , the ability to detect a hint of an odor before the wind changes is a more useful skill .","article":"Temporal experience of odor gradients is important in spatial orientation of animals . The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field . In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli , we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and projection neurons ( PNs ) . We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns , manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change . A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output . When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs , PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers , thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations . \n Odor distribution in nature is intermittent and dynamic ( Murlis et al . , 1992; Vickers et al . , 2001 ) , and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli ( David et al . , 1983; Thesen et al . , 1993; Vickers et al . , 2001; Porter et al . , 2007; Semmelhack and Wang , 2009; Kato et al . , 2014 ) . In one of the most sophisticated examples , Drosophila larvae with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron ( OSN ) are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves ( Louis et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) and staying within a specific odor zone ( Semmelhack and Wang , 2009 ) . In order to enable such odor-guided tasks , it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers . Several recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems ( systems consisting principally of OSNs and projection neurons [PNs] ) and observed significant temporal processing of odor signals ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007; Geffen et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011; Martelli et al . , 2013 ) . Most of these studies employed a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli without directly monitoring the actual odor concentration levels . For a rigorous understanding of sensory processing , however , it is essential to precisely measure the input stimuli and systematically explore the input space , as has been successfully done in the field of vision and audition ( Wu et al . , 2006 ) . Moreover , natural odor plumes are encountered in various spatiotemporal patterns , and their dynamics and statistics can influence the neural encoding mechanism ( Brenner et al . , 2000; Vickers et al . , 2001 ) . In Drosophila , OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments , termed olfactory glomeruli , which constitute a deutocerebral neuropil called the antennal lobe . PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn ( Stocker et al . , 1990 ) . Two recent studies independently reported that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time ( Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011 ) . Building on this recent advance , we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments . We tested OSNs and PNs with short plume-like odor stimuli in a variety of settings and analyzed the correlation structure of input\/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway . We also constructed a two-dimensional ( 2D ) linear\u2013nonlinear ( LN ) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli . \n We employed a novel odor delivery system that can reliably produce various odor concentration waveforms and provide measurements of the odor concentration with a millisecond resolution on every experiment trial ( Figure 1A , B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Various odor concentration profiles were designed and tested ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , and the corresponding OSN and PN responses were measured in two separate assays sharing the same odor delivery system ( Figure 1A , B ) . The observed odor concentrations were closely matched between the two assays ( Figure 2A\u2013C ) . We used acetone as the primary odorant because its low ionization potential afforded a high signal-to-noise ratio in our odor concentration measurements . We tested a pair of directly connected OSNs and PNs innervating the DM4 glomerulus with five different acetone concentration waveforms . The dynamics of OSN and PN responses differed significantly from their respective feedforward inputs , and all responses initiated within a few tens of milliseconds of the odor onset ( Figure 1C ) . PNs generally showed a bigger peak spike rate and exhibited more phasic spiking patterns than the presynaptic OSNs . However , the exact functional transformation between OSNs and PNs could not be readily assessed due to the complex dynamics of OSN and PN signals . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06651 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06651 . 006 We therefore designed a set of elementary odor concentration waveforms: a step , a ramp and a parabola ( top row of Figure 2A\u2013C ) . We reasoned that the simple nature of these waveforms would facilitate the analysis of the input\/output relationship . Consistent with previous reports ( Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011 ) , OSNs responded most strongly to polynomial waveforms when the odor concentration rose rapidly . For the ramp and parabola odor signals , OSN responses were the exact rate-of-change function of their input: a step output to a ramp input ( Figure 2B , E ) and a ramp output to a parabola input ( Figure 2C , F ) . This pattern of encoding was preserved for different combinations of odorants and OSN-PN pairs ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To look into this observation formally , we measured the similarity between three different input features\u2014concentration amplitude , rate of change , and acceleration\u2014and the output spike rate of OSNs by performing a set of cross-correlation analyses . The correlation was strong between the OSN output and both odor concentration and its rate of change , but weak between the OSN output and the acceleration of odor concentration ( Figure 2J ) . Given the very same panel of olfactory stimuli , PN responses exhibited bigger peak amplitude and more stereotyped temporal patterns than OSNs ( Figure 2G\u2013I ) . All PN responses transiently peaked at the time of the odor onset , and their peak times were on average advanced from the OSN peak times . Specifically , in response to ramp-shaped OSN signals , PNs exhibited a rapid step response ( Figure 2F , I ) . To step-like OSN signals , PN showed a phasic onset response , followed by a tonic spiking pattern ( Figure 2E , H ) . These input\/output relationships are reminiscent of the rate-of-change encoding in the odor-to-OSN transformation , where the ramp and step odor signals were similarly transformed . Biophysically , this phenomenon suggests a rapid adaptation between OSNs and PNs , which is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating strong short-term depression in synapses between OSNs and PNs ( Kazama and Wilson , 2008 , 2009; Nagel et al . , 2015 ) . From a modeling perspective , this observation predicted a strong correlation between the PN spike rate and the rate of change of the OSN spike rate . A correlation analysis between the PN output and three different input features\u2014OSN spike rate , rate of change , and acceleration\u2014confirmed this prediction ( Figure 2K ) . Together , this supports the hypothesis that PN responses can be modeled as a function of the OSN spike rate and its rate of change , at least for the tested class of odor stimuli . We therefore propose a simple model of the OSN-to-PN transformation comprising two input blocks: the OSN spike rate and its rate of change , followed by a 2D nonlinearity that maps these inputs into the PN spike rate ( Figure 3D ) . The model has the structure of a classical 2D LN model with its linear blocks postulated as amplitude and rate-of-change filters ( Brenner et al . , 2000; Geffen et al . , 2009 ) . Given the hypothesized input blocks , the model can be fully identified by estimating the nonlinear block from experimental data . The validity of the model can be tested by assessing its ability to predict the PN response to new odor waveforms . In order to estimate the nonlinearity , we first designed OSN spike activity profiles that explore the hypothesized PN input space with an efficient sampling grid . An ensemble of triangle-shaped inputs was shown to be suitable for this purpose , since each up\/down ramp stimulus tests the target system with a distinct pair of positive and negative gradients while also sweeping a wide range of input amplitudes ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06651 . 007Figure 3 . A simple two-dimensional ( 2D ) model characterizes the OSN-to-PN transformation . ( A ) Input\/output traces used in modeling the OSN-to-PN transformation ( n = 5 trials for both OSN and PN data ) .

( B ) Input and output samples for the 2D nonlinearity block . Input axes are OSN spike rate and its rate of change , and the output is the PN spike rate .

Six OSN spike rates\u2014five triangle-shaped signals and one step-pulse-shaped input\u2014and their rate-of-change functions were projected to the surface . Amplitude readouts from the trajectories on the surface constitute the simulated PN output . The step-pulse-shaped input was introduced for cross-validation of the model since this input was not used for building the model . ( F ) The predicted PN spike rate closely followed the magnitude and dynamics of the experimental PN spike rate , for six OSN spike rate inputs ( insets ) . The average prediction errors are 31 , 26 , 21 , 21 , 23 , 29 spike\/s ( clockwise from the top-left corner , in root-mean-square error ) .

( A ) The triangle-shaped OSN spike rate ( top ) , its rate of change ( middle ) , and the corresponding PN spike rates ( bottom ) . At a fixed OSN spike rate ( 60 spike\/s , a solid red line in the top panel ) , the PN spike rate varies from 0 to 280 spike\/s depending on the rate-of-change value of the OSN spike rate . ( B ) At a fixed OSN spike rate ( blue line for 30 spike\/s , red line for 60 spike\/s , green line for 120 spike\/s , as depicted in ( A ) ) , the PN spike rate is linearly related to the rate-of-change value of the OSN spike rate with half-wave rectification in the negative rate-of-change interval . ( C ) The gain \u03b2 of the PN response , with respect to the rate of change of the OSN output , decreases with increasing input amplitude . DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06651 . 008 How can we induce an ensemble of triangle signals at the OSN output ? We fine-tuned odor concentration signals , while observing the OSN spike rate , until the desired OSN spike rates were produced ( Figure 3A ) . The odor concentration signals inferred from this method are an ensemble of parabolas with systematically varying peak times and amplitudes ( Figure 3A ) . The 2D nonlinearity was estimated subsequently by running a ridge regression analysis on spike rate samples from the OSN and PN signals ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3B , C ) . The estimated 2D nonlinearity showed a strong dependency on the rate-of-change of OSN spike rate ( Figure 3B , C ) . When the nonlinearity was estimated for samples with a fixed odor concentration value , the PN spike rate rose almost linearly with respect to the rate of change ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , the gain of the PN output with respect to the OSN rate of change decreased monotonically with concentration , suggesting that at least a 2D model is required to describe the OSN-to-PN transformation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We tested the model by comparing the simulated model output with the experimental PN spike activity ( Figure 3C ) . With step , ramp , and parabola odor inputs , the experimental outputs were closely matched by the model ( root-mean-square error = 25 spike\/s , Figure 3F ) . While the odor-evoked responses were well matched by the model , including peak times and amplitudes , the model output often overestimated the actual PN spike rate before and after the stimulus interval . This is because the estimated nonlinearity exhibits a relatively high slope at low input amplitudes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which renders the system highly sensitive to the noisy fluctuations at low OSN spike rates ( Pahlberg and Sampath , 2011 ) . This problem is thought to be mitigated in olfactory glomeruli by pooling input from a population of OSNs , thereby achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio than provided by a single OSN ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 ) . In summary , the proposed simple 2D model provides a decent approximation of the OSN-to-PN transformation and corroborates the notion that PNs mainly encode OSN spike rate and its rate of change in a nonlinear fashion . What is the functional consequence of acceleration encoding by antennal lobe PNs ? In signal processing theory , the time derivative , or rate-of-change operation , advances the phase of a time signal . For example , cos ( t ) is the time derivative of sin ( t ) , and its phase is advanced by \u03c0\/2 . Similarly , the rate of change of a sample triangle-shaped signal shows an advancement of a peak time , and its acceleration exhibits a peak time that is further advanced ( Figure 4A ) . Therefore , we reasoned that the computation of the first and second time derivatives ( rate of change and acceleration ) of odor concentrations by OSN and PNs , respectively , acts to advance peak times of olfactory stimuli . To investigate this idea with a larger set of odor stimuli , we designed a set of triangle-shaped odor waveforms with peak times varying uniformly between 0 . 6 s and 1 . 7 s after the stimulus onset ( Figure 4B , \u2018odor\u2019 curve in Figure 4C ) . As shown in the previous experiments with triangle-shaped stimuli ( Figure 2B ) , OSNs responded in a pulse-shaped pattern ( Figure 4B ) , with the peak response advanced by 400\u20131000 ms relative to the stimulus peak ( \u2018OSN\u2019 curve in Figure 4C ) . In response to the same panel of odor stimuli , PNs consistently produced peak output ( Figure 4B ) at around 200 ms after the stimulus onset , regardless of the dynamics of the odor\/OSN signals ( \u2018PN\u2019 curve in Figure 4C ) . For the parabola-shaped odor stimuli ( Figure 3A ) , the peak OSN and PN responses were similarly advanced in time relative to the odor and OSN peaks ( right plot in Figure 4C ) but were more variable . The advancement of a peak time was previously reported for step-pulse odor stimuli ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 ) , and our work confirms this result for a larger set of dynamically varying odor stimuli . Together , we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli . 10 . 7554\/eLife . 06651 . 009Figure 4 . A cascade of rate-of-change encodings leads to a rapid detection of the stimulus onset .

DOI: http:\/\/dx . doi . org\/10 . 7554\/eLife . 06651 . 009 \n We tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information . The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input . When combined with the dynamic sensory encoding by OSNs\u2014encoding of odor concentration and its rate of change\u2014PNs signal the rate of change and , most strongly , the acceleration of odor concentration signals to higher brain centers . One remarkable example of the \u2018acceleration encoding\u2019 by PNs is found in the OSN\/PN responses to the parabolically rising odor input , where the onset is enormously amplified to create step-like responses in PNs ( Figure 2C , I ) . To the best of our knowledge , the encoding of acceleration by an olfactory sensory system has not been demonstrated elsewhere . This sensory encoding mechanism is distinguished from other chemosensory systems . For example , in bacterial chemotaxis , the rate of change of a stimulus is computed and fed directly into its motor system that controls the flagellar rotation ( Bourret et al . , 1991 ) . The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also exhibits a local-gradient-based chemotaxis behavior , and neurons in its sensorimotor pathway are shown to compute the rate of change of concentration gradients ( Suzuki et al . , 2008 ) . Why do fruit flies compute acceleration of odor concentrations ? How is the acceleration of an olfactory stimulus relevant to a fly's chemotaxis ? An efficient chemotaxis strategy should depend on the distribution of odor molecules in the behaviorally relevant range , which can be quantified using a Reynolds number ( Weissburg , 2000 ) . Habitats of both nematodes and bacteria have low Reynolds numbers ( Re < 1 ) , and thus the odor distribution is primarily determined by a diffusion process . In this environment , the steepest local odor gradient can be directly linked to the location of the odor source , and therefore animals in such environments are expected to encode the rate of change of odor concentrations in order to detect the steepest gradient . In contrast , flying insects experience fluid mechanics that have relatively high Reynolds numbers ( Re > 10 ) , with turbulence dictating the distribution of odor molecules over the diffusion process . In this regime , the local odor gradient within an odor plume would be less informative in determining the location of the odor source than the distribution of odor plumes over a macroscopic scale . In fact , it has been well established that insects , including fruit flies , use a strategy of turning upwind during odor plume encounters , a strategy that does not require interpreting local concentration gradients ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) . Furthermore , the relative position of a flying animal and the distribution of odor plumes evolve rapidly over time . It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes . We showed that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers . This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the acceleration encoding has evolved in Drosophila to maximize its chance to locate the odor source in a turbulent environment . It has also been shown that fruit flies can respond to the spatial difference of the odor concentration between two antennae in both walking and flight ( Duistermars et al . , 2009; Gaudry et al . , 2013 ) . However , even with the lack of spatial sampling ability , fruit fly larvae can locate an odor source , based on the temporal sampling of odor gradients ( Louis et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , adult fruit flies may rely on both spatial and temporal sampling methods to locate an odor source , although their relative importance may vary depending on the locomotive state , as Reynolds numbers are different between walking and flight . \n We built a precise and versatile odor delivery system ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . An odorant was diluted in dipropylene glycol , and 20 ml of the resulting mixture was put into a glass vial ( 30 ml ) and subsequently sealed by a screw cap with a silicone septa . Inlet and outlet needles were inserted into the vial headspace . The saturated vapor in this headspace was puffed by directing a low-flow air stream ( \u2264100 ml\/min ) from an air cylinder ( UN1002; TechAir , White Plains , NY ) into the odor vial by opening inlet and outlet solenoid valves ( Series 10; Parker-Hannifin Corporation , Cleveland , OH ) . Subsequently , the outlet needle carried the saturated vapor from inside the vial to a custom laminar mixer where the odor flow was combined with a strong carrier flow ( 800 ml\/min ) . The mixer was carefully designed so as to minimize the turbulence that could be formed when the low-flow odor stream is added to a high-flow-rate carrier stream . The output of the mixer was then directed to the antennae and maxillary palps of a prepared animal through a glass capillary ( 1 mm inner diameter ) . The interval between two consecutive puffs was between 45 s and 70 s depending on the amount of vapor consumed in each puff , and the mixture was replenished about every 10 trials . All flows were electronically controlled by a miniature pressure controller ( VSO-EP; Parker-Hannifin , OH ) and measured using a digital flow meter ( PV9000; Key Instruments , Trevose , PA ) in real time . After hitting the animal , the odor flow was immediately sucked into a probe and measured by a photoionization detector ( PID; Aurora Scientific , Canada ) with 1 l\/min flow rate . The output of the PID was digitally sampled at 10 kHz and later advanced by 2 ms in order to compensate for the latency caused by the suction probe . In order to convert the PID output voltage into the odor concentration in parts per million ( ppm ) , we regularly ( every 10 trials ) measured the output of the PID with a calibration odor ( 3% propylene ) and estimated the general sensitivity of the PID , which gradually decays over time . The PID sensitivity ratio of actual odor to standard odor was measured in a separate experiment with a fully saturated odor vapor and used to calculate a scaling factor between the PID output ( in Volts ) and the absolute odor concentration ( in ppm ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Drosophila stocks were maintained at room temperature on a 12-hr light\/12-hr dark schedule and kept in standard plastic vials containing a cornmeal agar medium . All experiments were carried out with female flies of the NP3062-GAL4\/NP3062-GAL4;UAS-mCD8::GFP\/UAS-mCD8::GFP;+\/+ genotype . NP3062-GAL flies were kindly provided by Kei Ito . Female flies 2\u20135 days posteclosion were used for both OSN and PN recordings . For the OSN recordings , single basiconic sensilla were targeted with electrolytically sharpened tungsten electrodes to measure the aggregate electrical activity of OSNs housed in these sensilla ( Figure 1B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Recordings were analyzed by a custom MATLAB code ( Source code 1 ) to sort out action potentials from Or59b or Or7a OSNs ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . For the PN recordings , a female fly was gently immobilized beneath a cellulose acetate film with an adhesive ( Datta et al . , 2008 ) . The film was then carefully transferred to a petri dish in which a circular hole was made at the center . When placing an animal in the hole , the location of the head was carefully adjusted so that the antennae and maxillary pals were located strictly within the odor stream between the odor delivery tubing and the suction probe , both of which were embedded in the petri dish . Antennal lobes were exposed by gently removing a head cuticle as well as the film under saline solution containing 108 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 8 . 2 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM NaHCO3 , 1 mM NaH2PO4 , 5 mM trehalose , 10 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES ( pH , 7 . 5; 265 mOsm ) ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . In order to access the PN somas , the perineural sheath was weakened by a 1\u20132 min treatment with 1 mg\/ml collagenase ( Type I Collagenase; Sigma\u2013Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The dorsal part of the sheath was then gently ruptured by a sharp quartz glass electrode using a micromanipulator ( MP-285; Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA ) . A ground electrode was placed into the saline solution and connected to a headstage amplifier ( CV-7B; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . In order to record action potentials of a single PN , a borosilicate patch electrode ( 7\u201310 M\u03a9 tip resistance ) filled with saline solution was attached to the target cell and gentle suction was applied through the electrode capillary until a loose seal ( 50\u2013100 M\u03a9 ) was formed . The current was amplified ( MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices , CA ) , low-pass filtered at 1 . 2 kHz , sampled at 10 kHz ( Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments ) , and stored on a computer by software ( Clampex; Molecular Devices , CA ) . The animal was alive and active for a few hours as indicated by the spontaneous extension of its legs . Fresh oxygenated saline solution was perfused throughout the experiment . Finally , the PNs innervating the DM4 and DL5 glomeruli were identified by genetic means , using an enhancer trap line expressing Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) in these cells . The identity of recorded cells was further verified by their odor response and the location of the soma in the dorsal cluster of the antennal lobe . Spike sequences were detected and sorted offline using custom software ( Source code 1 ) , written in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Spike rates of OSNs and PNs were estimated by constructing a peristimulus\u2013time histogram ( PSTH ) with a 100-ms bin size and a 75-ms overlap between adjacent bins . For the correlation analysis and 2D model prediction , the rate of change and acceleration components of odor and OSN traces were estimated by a forward difference equation , with the difference time interval as the scaling factor; for example , dxdt=[x ( t\u2212\u0394 ) \u2212x ( t ) ]\/\u0394 , where x represents either the odor concentration or the OSN response , and \u0394 denotes the time interval . The time interval was 50 ms for the odor rate of change , 100 ms for odor acceleration , the OSN rate of change and OSN acceleration . Since the output of the forward difference equation is sensitive to high-frequency components of the signal , we low-pass filtered the amplitude and rate-of-change signals before deriving the rate of change and acceleration , respectively . Cut-off frequencies of the low-pass filters were 20 Hz for the odor amplitude , 10 Hz for the odor rate of change , 4 Hz for the OSN spike rate , and 4 Hz for the OSN rate of change . The cross-correlation coefficient , \u03f1 ( x , y ) between an input x and the corresponding output y was computed as a normalized cross-covariance function; that is , \u03f1 ( x , y ) =1N\u2211i=1N ( x[i]\u2212\u03bcx ) ( y[i]\u2212\u03bcy ) \u03c3x\u03c3y , where \u03bc and \u03c3 are , respectively , the mean and standard deviation of the variable in the subscript . We hypothesized a nonlinear function f ( . , . ) that takes inputs from the OSN spike rate y and its rate of change dy\/dt and whose output corresponds to the PN spike rate z; for example , z=f ( y , dydt ) , and f ( . , . ) was estimated using a 2D ridge regression method on 100 \u00d7 100 grids ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) .","headings":["Abstract","Introduction","Results","Discussion","Materials and methods"],"keywords":["short report","neuroscience"],"id":"elife-06651-v2"}
